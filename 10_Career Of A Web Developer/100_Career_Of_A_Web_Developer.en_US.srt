1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:08,030
Every decision that will require significant time of your life should be justified, and in this video,

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,850
we're going to talk about career of a web developer.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,810
Now, I'm going to be talking about three things specifically, and this is a bit of a unique section,

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,580
unlike all the other ones where we just code along and learn new skills.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,080
I want to talk about three things in this video.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,100
One is, why would you even want to be a developer?

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,540
And I know you're taking the course.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,140
I know you're committed, but I want to talk to you about why it is such a good decision to become a

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,620
developer and some of the freedom that it allows in your life.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:46,230
The second is we're going to talk about which tools you should learn to be a successful developer.

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:53,060
And then finally, the third, we're going to talk about what career options there are out there currently.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,690
So let's tackle the first one.

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,940
Why you would want to be a developer.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,960
Now, I know a lot of people taking this course aren't necessarily from the states.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,190
I'm not either.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,360
But I wanted to show you how much in demand a good developer is over here.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,600
I have some salaries for developers around the states and you can see that as a front end developer.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,730
You have some really, really nice salaries.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,500
A lot higher than most industries, and if you go to Glassdoor, another website, that's really, really

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,080
good to find out what salaries are and you can do location specific to you.

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,070
And I have salaries in San Francisco, which I know.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,180
I know there are way too inflated because to live there, it's very expensive.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,890
But I do want to show you that there's a real value for developers out there.

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,630
I've worked in the industry for many years and finding a job as a developer was, quite frankly, very

25
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,080
easy.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,490
And I'm not trying to be cocky or overconfident, but it is true.

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,050
Speak to any developer that knows his or her stuff and they're able to find jobs quite easily.

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,470
And most times you're interviewing you're interviewing the employer to see that this is a place that

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,110
you would want to work because you have so many options.

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:16,920
But.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,080
You probably already know this, you're taking this course for a reason, so let's talk about what you

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,710
should learn.

33
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,790
I have for you a couple of surveys here to show you the industry.

34
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,560
Dummett, the first one is from GEP Brains, a very, very big software company.

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,260
And it talks about JavaScript and which frameworks are the most popular.

36
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,310
The one we're going to learn in this course is react, and you can see here it is the most popular,

37
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,100
this probably the most well respected and a lot of big companies are using it.

38
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:00,190
It was developed at Facebook and now it is used by Netflix and a ton of other big companies that do

39
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,750
big things technologically.

40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,400
You can also see that what editors and yds developers regularly use and we see that sublime text is

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,610
number one, and that is what we are using in this course.

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,280
Let's take a look at Stack Overflow.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,310
For those that don't know, Stack Overflow is probably the best website there is for developers throughout

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,910
your career.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,150
You'll go on to this website to ask questions and get answers almost daily.

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,630
And one of the things that they do quite often is a survey and a stack overflow trends analysis.

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,000
And you can see over here that JavaScript.

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,200
Is trending quite, quite high all the way into this year and into next year.

49
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,270
It is a very in demand language.

50
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,580
It can be used on the web, on mobile, on little devices, pretty much anywhere.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,440
If you can code JavaScript, you can code anything electronic at this point in time.

52
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,130
So that is why we're learning JavaScript.

53
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,270
Let's look at the next one.

54
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,490
This one is by GitHub, and you're going to get to know GitHub a lot better in the section that we will

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,060
have for GitHub and get.

56
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,810
But I want to show you their stats on open source projects and you'll see that JavaScript is in the

57
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,260
lead with two point three million projects.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,060
I love the language, it's a great language to learn as your first one, and it can take you really,

59
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,630
really far.

60
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,660
Finally, I made this little diagram for us.

61
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,010
Just so you have a big picture of what we're going to learn in this course.

62
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,730
We're going to learn basic skills like putting a website online and terminal usage, getting GitHub

63
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,330
and press Web services.

64
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,080
We're also going to do front end work.

65
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,140
And some of the videos have already gone through this.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,320
But we learn HTML five, six, three.

67
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,490
Now, this is kind of interchangeable, but if you want to be a designer, you are more likely going

68
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,390
to focus on access, responsive design and other tools like Photoshop, sketch and illustrator.

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,940
And this is not the course for it.

70
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,360
We are becoming developers, so we're going to learn JavaScript instead.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,000
And JavaScript probably has a couple of libraries and frameworks that are really, really popular.

72
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,700
And the one used most often in mid 2000 was Jorquera.

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,880
But that is now very outdated and you'll still see it here and there, but you won't see a lot of the

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,560
big top websites using it.

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,900
So we won't be focusing on that.

76
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,170
We'll just cover it slightly.

77
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,600
But it is not really a an employable skill to learn.

78
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,750
And then I want to draw your attention to three other libraries and frameworks and what those are tools

79
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,780
for developers to build websites and Web applications, and in this course, we're going to learn,

80
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,220
react, and you'll get to understand the technology behind a lot more.

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,260
But I chose react because it is currently the most popular way to build Web applications and the developer

82
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,590
community around it is very, very big angular.

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,470
James was very popular a few years ago, but it's kind of starting to die down right now.

84
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,980
And I personally think there's a bigger future with react.

85
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,050
And some people may disagree, but.

86
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,490
Having worked in the industry and seeing people's reaction to different technologies, I really think

87
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,900
we're going to go really far and you'll hear a ton about it.

88
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:45,060
View is the up and comer that it's fairly new, the community is a lot smaller, so there is not as

89
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,610
much information out there as there is for react.

90
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,180
But we won't be covering that topic again because we're focusing on the most employable skills that

91
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,920
is JavaScript with react.

92
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,770
Finally, let's talk about career options.

93
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,750
We're going to talk about the type of work that you will be able to get as a developer and some of the

94
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,490
confusing job titles that are out there.

95
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,710
So let's start off with the job titles.

96
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,050
You might know what Web developers, because while you've signed up for this course, that is somebody

97
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,680
who works on the web, builds websites, builds Web applications.

98
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,120
We also touched on the back end developer, and that is the person that works on the server, works

99
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,970
with some databases, and they aren't too concerned with user facing side of a website or a Web app.

100
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,770
A full stack developer is somebody that can work both on the front end and back end, and in this course

101
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,310
we're going to learn both front end and back end.

102
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,370
So you'll be able to call yourself a full stack developer because you'll understand the full picture

103
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,770
of how these web technologies work.

104
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,260
We also have mobile developer.

105
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:03,460
And the reason that I use react in this course is that even though it is a course geared towards web

106
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,490
development, using 90 percent of the things you'll learn with react, you'll be able to build an Android

107
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,940
app and and iOS app very easily.

108
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,010
And then finally, the two things at the end here we have software developer, and that is somebody

109
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:25,600
that is able to build software, not necessarily on the web, not necessarily on mobile.

110
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:34,060
They're able to use a programming language to build software that is code that can be run anywhere.

111
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:43,540
And then finally, software engineers use computer science to solve complex machine problems.

112
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,280
And that is a very, very broad statement, but it is there not necessarily good at one quoting language,

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,990
they're good at working with machines.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,760
So I just wanted to throw that out there.

115
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,470
So, you know what the differences are when you are looking for jobs out there.

116
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,610
Now, let's talk about the fun stuff, the type of work you'll be able to do when you become a web developer.

117
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:17,230
And ideally, if you go full force into this course and you really learn the concepts that we cover

118
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,650
in this course, the type of work that you can do with this.

119
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,070
So the first one is entrepreneurship.

120
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,530
And obviously, when you're able to build websites and you're able to build landing pages and applications,

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,960
well, you can start your own business.

122
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,790
If you have that ambition and idea, then entrepreneurship is definitely a good avenue to go.

123
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,820
And it is part of the reason that I myself became a developer initially.

124
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:50,810
The second one is start ups, if you want to work for young companies that are moving fast and creating

125
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:58,610
some really cool technologies or innovations while startups are always looking for developers.

126
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,700
We also have freelance and that is being able to work on your own terms and, you know, using websites

127
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,570
like up work to look for contract jobs and build quick projects for people around the world as they

128
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,290
need fit and, you know, running a little business for yourself.

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,420
The next one is working for the big tech companies.

130
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,450
So that's Facebook, Google, Amazon.

131
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:30,110
If you're in the States, if you're somewhere else around the world, you have your own big tech companies

132
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:37,310
and they are always a great place to get hired as a developer because they have massive teams.

133
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,850
They're solving really, really big problems and they need all the developer knowledge that they can

134
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,110
get.

135
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:51,350
It is not for everybody, but they are great places to be surrounded by really, really smart people

136
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,120
and learn from them.

137
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,810
We also have ad agencies, so ad agencies always have contracts where they have a company that is working

138
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,060
with them and they usually need some sort of a website or a promo site built for them.

139
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,850
And they have staff developers that help them work on these different projects with different clients.

140
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,260
And then finally, I bolded this, and that is remote work.

141
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,730
I know a lot of developers that get into devolvement because of this idea of being able to work remotely

142
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,700
and not that is absolutely true.

143
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,190
If that is the type of life that you want and that is the type of career that you want, working remotely

144
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,300
is definitely something that a developer is able to do.

145
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,720
Because let's be honest, to be a developer, all you need is an Internet connection, and you don't

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,680
necessarily need to be face to face with a client, with a coworker, with an employer, because, like

147
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,940
I said, everything is on a computer.

148
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,020
So that is not for everybody, but it is an option and it is an attractive option for some.

149
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,620
So what was the meaning of this video then?

150
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,490
Well, we went over a few things because I wanted you to understand what we are doing in this course.

151
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,480
But there's an important point I really want to emphasize that is to keep in mind that when you start

152
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,260
off something like learning development skills, the first two months will feel like you're climbing

153
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,150
an insurmountable mountain.

154
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,840
Every video or course tutorial or book that you read is going to make you feel like you're the only

155
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,210
person in the world that doesn't know this stuff.

156
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,010
But I'm here to tell you to stay strong.

157
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,620
I went through it.

158
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,750
Every single developer has gone through it.

159
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:47,330
You'll get there and you'll have more and more aha moments as time progresses.

160
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,620
And we even have a word for this in the industry.

161
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,240
It's called the imposter syndrome, where you feel like you're the only one who doesn't know this information.

162
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,330
Rest assured, we all feel this way when we learn something new.

163
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,320
What you'll learn is that being a good developer isn't necessarily memorizing a whole bunch of documentation

164
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,010
or code.

165
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,280
It's about learning how to solve problems, using all the tools that are available to you.

166
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,720
And I'm going to leave you with that.

167
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,380
Being a developer isn't easy, you really do need to know your stuff, so follow along this course and

168
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,580
really engage in all the lessons and all the exercises.

169
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,840
And if you have questions, ask them, because in demand, developers are problem solvers, not just

170
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,290
coders.

171
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
Can we see in the next video?
