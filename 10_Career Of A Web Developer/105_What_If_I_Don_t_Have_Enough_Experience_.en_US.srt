1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,810
"What do I do if I don't have enough experience?"
"What if I'm underqualified for a job?"

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:12,187
Well, first of all, you should have this
mentality in mind when applying to jobs

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,188
and apply to jobs that you feel
you are under qualified for.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,670
If a job is asking you to do something
that you already feel confident

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,020
then you should ask yourself "What
am I going to learn in this job?".

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,650
"Am I going to learn actually, is this job going to
put things on my resume that will make me get better

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,889
and get a better position in the future?

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,940
Or am I just going to do the same thing that
I already know what to do or how to do it?"

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,190
Finally, you have to keep in mind that job postings
are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,179
I have seen way too many of these created by non-technical
people or just making job sound tougher than

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,830
it really is to remove junior
developers or engineers from applying.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,160
So ask yourself:
"Is this job going to be tough?"

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,590
Good, then

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,100
that is what you want. That's
why you should be doing.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,440
Do you feel competent?

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,940
You are very qualified for this job.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,410
Ok then, maybe you should push yourself and apply
to a job that's more difficult than you think.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,650
Every application should be a long shot. If you're applying
to something that you're 100 percent qualified for

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,220
where is your room to grow?

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,890
So dream big.

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,860
But in order to dream big,
you might have a bit of a roadblock.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,750
What if you don't have enough experience?

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,540
See, I don't love resumes and I don't
think a lot of people do either.

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,050
But sometimes without a resume you cannot get an
interview. And in order to have a good resume

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,990
you need to have something to put on
it, like great experience.

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,870
Here's the catch though: "How can you have good
experience if you're just getting started?"

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,639
It's like you have no hope if you're a beginner or
if you don't have enough work experience because

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,760
you're just out of school
or you're changing careers.

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,040
Well not quite.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,990
As with everything there's the
regular way of doing things

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,150
then there's the smart way.

32
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:15,135
You see experience doesn't come just
from working at another company.

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,430
There are many ways that you can
demonstrate experience without a past job.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,050
And here you'll find my
favorite ways to show improve.

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,930
You can get the job done.

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
You won't have to do
every single one of them.

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,579
But two out of four of
these or even better

38
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,990
three out of four, will be great at showcasing
on your resume and make you stand up.

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,820
So let's go in order and
see how we can do this.

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,010
The first one is GitHub.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,300
GitHub is a great way to demonstrate that you
actually code that you've built projects.

42
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:56,620
The number one thing you can do is to start making
commits and making sure that you have a good history

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,460
of things that you've done.

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,249
And by the way if you're wondering how I got this
cat picture in here I'll show you a little trick in

45
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,989
the next exercise to make your contribution
look a little bit nicer and busier.

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,940
In case you're just getting started and you don't
have a good past history. Another way to improve your

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,990
GitHub profile or to just add more experience is
contributing and participating in open source projects.

48
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:34,949
For example I've created a zero to mastery organization
where we have a ton of open source projects

49
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:43,309
by the community that you can contribute to and they're
made specifically for you to mess up, make mistakes.

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,489
Nobody is going to yell you.

51
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,979
These are just fun projects that are open source that
you can contribute to and you can do as much or as

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,855
little as you want but this will improve your
experience and contributing to open source projects and

53
00:03:55,856 --> 00:04:01,270
it's something you can add to your resumes.
Now, contributing to open source projects

54
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,829
recruiters love seeing this because this demonstrates
you can work with others and also with something

55
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,110
like GitHub and version control.

56
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,650
All right let's look at the next one.

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,940
The next one is website.

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,490
If you are especially a full-stack or front-end
developer or even a designer you should have your own

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,850
website where you can showcase your skills.

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,899
This again is something you can speak about in your
interview and about how you built the website or it gives

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,980
you a good way to talk
about your past projects.

62
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,089
Now you're asking yourself: "Ah! Andrei, am I going to
have to build a whole new website and waste a bunch

63
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,650
of time?"

64
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,679
Well not really.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,910
Let me show you a couple of tricks. You see you
don't need to build your own website from scratch.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,049
There's a ton of free templates like creative tim
here that just gives you a nice template for you

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,010
to use and fill in with your information.
We can also look at this one.

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,130
And again free templates that you can use.

69
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,610
I especially like the mountain
template and you can see that, yeah!

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,510
I mean you can customize this to your own and make it
look professional and it's already designed nicely

71
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:21,900
and also customized for different experiences such
as mobile, tablet and in a day you can have your own

72
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,450
website.

73
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,680
And just to show you how you shouldn't really
spend too much time on your own website.

74
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,390
One of my favorite people
to follow is Kevin Kelly.

75
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,780
He is very very popular among the tech community
and he's just overall really smart thinker.

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,860
And you can see his website over here.

77
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,550
It's very simple.

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,860
Nothing exaggerated.

79
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,670
A very very clean but
small very basic layout.

80
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,430
And this is to show you that you
don't need some crazy animations.

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,939
Make it all flashy to stand out.
As long as you have a personal website

82
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,190
it just shows that you actually spend time building
it and doing something that most people wouldn't do.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,610
Another thing that I want to show you is for example
the jobboard that we have for all of my students

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,680
and this is again another open source
project that the community built.

85
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:24,199
If we just search through let's say Toronto developers
here and we go to Christine Aqui I hope I'm

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
saying the last thing right.

87
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,790
You can see how simple yet
beautiful her portfolio is.

88
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:36,109
If we go to about me just a nice little bio with links
to her profile if we go to projects we see some

89
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,220
other projects.

90
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,650
And this is something that she can put on her
resume and immediately stand out from the crowd.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,909
And it also gives her an opportunity to list projects
that she can talk about when she gets to an interview.

92
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,590
All right let's look at the next topic.

93
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,520
1 ~ 2 big projects. Now

94
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:04,800
you can't really fake experience. If you've never built
anything beyond a "to-do list" or a "Hello World" app

95
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,300
you simply will not be
able to get very good jobs.

96
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,730
However, most people think having a
hundred projects is the way to go.

97
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:21,349
So they do a project today and build small projects
many small tiny projects to have 30 of them and

98
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,490
they start building all these
projects that are very very simple.

99
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,269
Now that's not actually impressive.

100
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,680
I mean it shows that you're
working hard and coding along.

101
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:39,009
But if I'm a recruiter you can show me a project of
maybe "tic-tac-toe" but I don't really care that's

102
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,740
something that anybody can build with a
bit of coding experience in a day or two.

103
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,860
Frankly no recruiter or interviewer is going to
check out all your 30 projects. Most of the time

104
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,709
we want to hear your most
difficult or the hardest

105
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,850
biggest project you've worked on. Instead of
spending your time on these small little projects

106
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,720
spend your time on one or two big projects.
For example; in other course that I teach

107
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:13,250
we built a face recognition app.
And this app, well has a front end

108
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:21,570
using React.js, a backend where we have a RESTful API
server with Express. We've deployed it to Heroku.

109
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:32,010
We've created session management with authenticator
routes, we store user information such as username.

110
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,019
And also hashed passwords securely
in our database on Postgres.

111
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:46,180
We've deployed our app with Docker and we've also
used redis for session management and caching.

112
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,309
Now all of that may not mean a lot to you but having
something like a one big project they can talk

113
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,369
about all these things, will make you sound a lot
more impressive than somebody that just built a ton

114
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,860
of tiny projects. So focus on that have 1 to 2 big
projects that you can show off makes you stand out.

115
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,340
And it's also going to give you something to talk about
during the interview and put it up on your website

116
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:19,510
or create its own website and you immediately can
put this as the first item on your resume. Because

117
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,679
here's the thing; if you
don't have work experience

118
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,030
if we go back to the resume
we used in the exercise.

119
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,590
Remember this resume.

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:36,619
Well if you have no work experience, maybe for work
experience you can say something like javascript

121
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,840
developer or web application developer and
talk about how you build your project here.

122
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,060
Because to a recruiter it doesn't really matter if you
worked at a certain company building an application

123
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,539
or on your own or that could
be a little bit vague too.

124
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,790
They don't need to know that.

125
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,609
They just need to know that you build things that are
real that are big and complicated and you solved

126
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,929
hard problems.

127
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:11,209
So having one or two big projects they you can list
on your experiences, is a great way to add to your

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,350
resume if you don't have enough
past work experience at companies.

129
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,779
And I have a few students who have actually used this
technique to get interviews, even though they just

130
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,820
learn how to code

131
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:31,149
six months ago. And then finally
we have the blog posts or blog.

132
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,760
Let's have a look at what I mean by that.

133
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,479
This is another thing you can include in your resume,
especially if it's related to a technology you're

134
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,410
using or the company is using.

135
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:50,550
For example I have here my medium profile. medium.com
allows anybody around the world to just post

136
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,810
a blog post and it's very popular with the tech
community so there's a lot of tech related posts that

137
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,610
you right on medium and there's
other platforms like this.

138
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:07,350
What if you wrote a blog post about a specific
technology that the company you're applying for is using

139
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,400
or some sort of a technical problem that they're facing?
By doing that and just adding a link to that blog post.

140
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,750
It gives you again another
leg up to most people.

141
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,350
And the great thing about platforms like this is that
well if we go to one of my articles here you can

142
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,850
post it to what we call publishers and publishers
allow your post to be discovered by others.

143
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,459
And it's very simple to do.

144
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,279
You can write a blog post on medium in a day and submit
it to a place like hackernoon and lots of people

145
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:48,040
see it. And as soon as you show this to a recruiter
or an interviewer, again it automatically shows that

146
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,049
you know what you're talking about or at least it
makes you stand out from the rest. And you can do this

147
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,320
with YouTube videos as well.

148
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,820
But I prefer writing because it's a lot
faster and it looks a lot more professional.

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,030
So let's just review here; "what happens
if you don't have enough experience?"

150
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,980
Well all of these four points allow you to gain that
experience or show that you have experience without

151
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,060
actually having traditional
work experience.

152
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,360
All you need to do is start something on your own
and build something like a project or a portfolio

153
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,550
or a blog post.

154
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,000
This only shows initiative but you can focus
this project on solely getting your interviews.

155
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:37,029
Or you can participate in a hackathon or contribute
to open source projects. By taking this initiative

156
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,950
you're doing more than most people that hope to
just land an interview by sending a generic resume.

157
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,640
You'll immediately stand out from the crowd and
give you something to put on your resume that again

158
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,080
is different than the average developer.

159
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,950
Plus you have the added benefit of something
to talk about in your actual interview.

160
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,779
Remember nothing is given to you for free and luck
is for those who rather wait and go after what they

161
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,310
want so by simply building something
just for fun such as a side project.

162
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,289
You're showing how self-motivated
and ambitious you are.

163
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,480
Experience doesn't mean
on the job experience.

164
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,370
Write about your portfolio projects.

165
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,409
Maybe talk about your
website and how you built it.

166
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,719
Talk about your GitHub profile maybe a hackathon you
participate in and or open source projects you've

167
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,069
worked on.

168
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,909
Write a blog post on a specific technology that the
company you're applying to is using. All of them

169
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,970
answer this question:
"Do you have experience?"

170
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,059
Finally there are many things that you can add that are
not developer related, but can make you a great employee.

171
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,420
For example, "did you work
as an instructor at a camp?"

172
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,070
Well you can now add ability to manage
people and communicate well with others.

173
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,310
Any skill that is related to getting
the job done can be included.

174
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,400
Also if you have only had six months of coding
experience, don't show that on the resume.

175
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,550
That doesn't mean to lie but to hide that information.
Because a recruiter only glances at your resume.

176
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,740
They won't care if you're the best developer in
the world if they just see six months experience.

177
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,669
That's too risky for them.

178
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,730
Your resume will most likely be discarded
no matter how good of a developer you are.

179
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:34,129
So remember resumes are only good to get your foot
in the door. By tweaking your resume to show that

180
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,279
you have experience so that the recruiter thinks "Oh
interviewing this person is low risk because they

181
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,380
know what they're talking about",
is a good way of doing it.

182
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,079
"Do you have past experience?
Have you made good decisions in the past?

183
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:51,740
And have you worked on a challenging
problem and solve them?"

184
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,710
If you're able to answer yes to that

185
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:59,274
well then a recruiter is most likely
going to ask you for an interview.

186
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,980
I'll see you in the next video.
