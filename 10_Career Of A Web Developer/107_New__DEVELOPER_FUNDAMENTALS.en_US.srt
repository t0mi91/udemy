00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Welcome to another developer fundamental video. I think you know what that means.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,970
"How's it going John?"

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,640
"Not bad partner. Follow me I'll cover you."

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:19,710
A developer needs to solve problems that there aren't clear answers to. 

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,730
The best developers are the ones who are left to their own devices to figure out a problem.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,760
They are able to find errors in their code and solve it themselves.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,530
They have questions or something they don't understand.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,990
Well no problem.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,750
They know how to use the resources they have to figure it out.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,270
At the end of the day we are engineers.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,730
This is what we do and this is a developer fundamental.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,720
How can we solve this problem you're having when I'm not around to answer these questions for you.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,140
So how can you practice this?

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,280
Let me introduce you to your most important resource

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,130
as a developer: Stackoverflow. Stackoverflow is probably in the top five most used tools by any developer.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:13,640
Whether you're a game developer or a network admin a security expert or a web developer.

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,090
Every day people in the field post questions you get answers from some of the best in the world.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,530
The website is so extensive that the question you have is most likely already asked and answered.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,250
I can't remember how many times stackoverflow has saved me when I was stuck on a problem.

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,590
So in this short video I want to show you an important skill a developer should have - that is problem solving.

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,260
In real life, You don't have a teacher or

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,320
an instructor you can just ask for an answer every time you are stuck.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,170
No, most likely you have to figure things out yourself using the tools at your disposal.

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm not joking when I say most developers spend half their time on google.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,260
I want to start practicing that muscle.

26
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,250
When you have a question ask yourself,

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,700
"Knowing what I know and the tools at my disposal what is the best way for me to get to the end - to solve

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,540
this problem?"

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:15,810
The first step when you are stumped is to Google. And most likely one of the first links that pops up

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,430
if you include the word Javascript or CSS or HTML 

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,140
well most likely one of the first links will be stackoverflow.

32
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,740
So let me show you an example and take you through a real life scenario.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,020
I've got a piece of text which is a string and I need to find how many exclamation marks it has.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:49,320
Well again just Google something along the lines of "check if string contains substring javascript".

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,660
So I just Googled this.

36
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,940
Let's see what pops up.

37
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,410
And yeah we have a whole bunch of things, and you can see that the first two links are stackoverflow.

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,010
So I would click on this and see that,

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,360
all right the question is, you know, "I would expect a string that contains method but there doesn't seem

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,760
to be one." well, Javascript doesn't have one.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,650
And people have answered this and you can see over here that there's a few things.

42
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,350
One while there's 49 answers that's a lot there's votes, that's all this.

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,300
It's active.

44
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,960
I usually like looking at the both because the top answer will have the most upvotes.

45
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,640
You can see here that this person has a ton.

46
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,880
It also has a checkmark.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,610
This checkmark means that the person who asked the question has verified that this infact works.

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,680
And usually I like looking at the top answer and 

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:45,920
then kind of browsing through the second answer as well.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,990
Just make sure that I didn't miss anything because sometimes when new things happen this question might

51
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,440
have been ask let's see when it was asked.

52
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,780
It was asked eight years ago.

53
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:02,720
Maybe the top answer since then, maybe Javascript included a contains method that we can use on strings

54
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,710
and maybe the top answer now isn't exactly the top answer anymore.

55
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,930
So I like scrolling through or making sure that you know maybe the first three answers are good but

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,390
if you scroll up over here we see that this person actually kept updating their answer and even has

57
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,340
the ES6 method "includes".

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,870
So now that I know I see that, oh! I can just use the 'includes' function and with the 'includes' function

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,310
I can just do something like this.

60
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,080
I can say does the string

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,060
"Helloooo!" with an exclamation mark.

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,210
Well does "Helloooo!" have an exclamation mark?

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,060
and I get an error, well because if I look over here it's not 'include' it is 'includes'. Let me try that again

64
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,540
and I get 'true'.

65
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,540
If I do a let's say an 'a'.

66
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,340
I get 'false' because well, it doesn't including anything.

67
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,490
So there you go stackoverflow

68
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,060
just answered my question.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
And you can see over here there's a few other things that you can look at.

70
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:19,240
One is, you can look at some of the comments that people have made and comments usually have votes as

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,860
well so I like looking at comments with a lot of votes.

72
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,390
And you can see people have provided valuable links.

73
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,730
You also see that on the right hand side you have linked answer so maybe this page doesn't answer you

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,520
but stackoverflow is smart enough to say, "Hey! maybe this is why you're looking for:" 

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
and you have 'related' you have a ton.

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,390
The last thing I want to point out is you also want to look at usually the person that's answering. 

77
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:56,810
You see that 'Fabien' which has a lot of gold stars and a lot of points on stackoverflow,

78
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,160
well this person answering.

79
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,620
This person looks pretty pretty credible from all their stats.

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,770
So that is most likely a good answer by this and actually know a few companies that look at stackoverflow profiles

81
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,310
to see how good of a developer a person is, because if you're a developer that answers questions

82
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,870
on stackoverflow and provide a lot of value,

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
well, you must be a good developer.

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,380
So remember this Googling and stackoverflow is very important.

85
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,240
If you don't find the answer there you can create an account and 

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,110
ask yourself the question on stackoverflow.

87
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,310
But better yet go to the zero-to-mastery Slack chat

88
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,750
and if your question wasn't answered on stackoverflow

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,460
again, go to our community here and you have a ton of channels that you can ask questions in.

90
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,860
For example if you are on channels of here you'll see all the channels that we have if you have

91
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,830
Bootstrap questions, if you have Github questions, you go into the community and you ask all your questions.

92
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,420
The Javascript channel is always always active.

93
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,590
Very very helpful people on there.

94
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,250
And remember you have a community of developers even after you're done with this course

95
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,400
where they're willing to help you.

96
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,470
So it is good to practice not just asking questions all the time but discovering answers yourself.

97
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,710
Learn to debug your own code.

98
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,720
Develop them muscle and you'll be a great developer.

99
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,040
See you in the next one. Bye-bye
