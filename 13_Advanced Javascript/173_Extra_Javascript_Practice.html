Anyway, I wanted to share with you the 3 free resources that I recommend. In my opinion they offer incredible insight into Javascript and are better than most paid options out there. They will really solidify your knowledge if you do them along with the course, in your spare time, or throughout your career:</p><p>1. <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS</a><br>2. <a href="http://javascript.info/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="http://javascript.info/">http://javascript.info/</a><br>3. <a href="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/">http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/</a><br><br>or... you can scroll all the way to the bottom of this course to <strong>Extras: Bonus Part 2 </strong> to see some more Advanced JS that I teach :)</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
