1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,600
So in the past, the way we would solve this is we would do an if statement, right?

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,530
So let me just remove myself from now and in here.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm also going to minimize this.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,350
So is just Andre Pokémon object.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:27,470
And in here, instead of doing what we've done here, we would do if and say, Andre Pokémon, DOT Pikachu

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,460
and if Andre Pokemon dot.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,690
Pikachu Dot, wait, let's make this a little bit smaller so we can see.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Then.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,620
We want to.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,640
Create weight to the variable.

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,980
Otherwise.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:04,390
Way to equals undefined, so by doing this, we won't get that error so we can check to see if Andre

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,320
has Pikachu.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,290
So if I copy this over, let me just remove this from now.

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,480
If I copy this over, hit enter, I get no errors.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,330
And if I add console logs in here.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,410
Run this again.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:43,090
You see that I get on to find because, well, it will realize that Andre Pokémon Object doesn't contain

19
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,410
Pikachu, so this is actually pretty annoying to do.

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:55,030
And you'll see often code bases have something like this and then do Andre Pokemon and they keep checking.

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,090
Does this exist?

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,270
Does this object exist?

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,810
Does this object exist?

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,000
So on and so forth.

25
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,820
So the cool thing about optional chaining is that, well, it avoids this complication.

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,920
So I can change this to say, let's wait three.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
Equal Andre Pokémon.

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,490
I can say, is there an object and then do Pikachu?

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:32,240
Is there an object or a property of Andre Pokemon that is Pikachu and then do dot wait.

30
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,360
So by doing this, check this out.

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,440
If I do console log wait and I copy this.

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,710
I get the same thing, I get undefined because it checks all of these and eventually because Pikachu

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:58,660
cannot be found in this object, it's going to assign undefined to wait three without throwing any errors.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,980
But if I did have Pikachu.

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,820
And I tried this again.

36
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,760
You'll see that I get 30, so everything is working, so instead of having those long if statements,

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,980
I can just check for properties with this question mark.

38
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,250
Very, very cool.

39
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,100
Now, this video's getting long, so let's take a pause and then we're going to visit Nola's coalescing

40
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,810
in the next video by.
