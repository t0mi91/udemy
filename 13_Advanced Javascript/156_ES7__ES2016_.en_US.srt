00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,910
ES7 which was introduced in 2016, is very very easy to grasp.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,730
Why?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,400
Well, because unlike ES6 which had a lot of changes.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,390
ES7 only has two additions to the language. In this video,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,530
I'll go through both of them. The first one, we're going to talk about is the 'includes' method 

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,050
that was added on strings and arrays.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,770
Let me show you.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:44,350
I can do something like "'Hellooooo'.includes", And I can say, 'o' and if it includes 'o', I'll get a true.

9
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,160
We can also use it on arrays.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:01:03,720
So for example, if I had an array, let's call it 'pets' and in the 'pets' I have a 'cat', 'dog' and a 'bat'

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,870
I know that's a weird pet.

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,670
But sure there's some bats pets out there.

13
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,310
All right.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,900
And now in here, if I do 'pets.includes('dog')'.

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:27,440
Well, if I run this, in the console, I get true, if I do 'pets.includes('bird')', I'll get false because it

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,370
doesn't include bird.

17
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,630
Very simple.

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,140
That's it.

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,280
That's one of them.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,690
And then the second one is the exponential operator.

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:44,740
So if I wanted to have a function that let's say 'square' something, I can do

22
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:56,590
function 'x' is 'x star star 2' and that means 'x' to the power of two.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:04,860
So again, if I run this and then I do 'square' of two.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,350
Oh! and I cannot spell.

25
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,100
Let's try that again, 'square' two.

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,320
I get four.

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,160
I do 'square' of five.

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,250
I get 25.

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,040
If I wanted to expand on this and do a 'cube',

30
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,670
Well I can do 'cube', will have 3, exponential 3.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:40,590
So again and by clearing this, just to make a bit of space and I do 'cube' of three, I get 27, 'cube' of 4 is 64

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,710
and that's it.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,700
Isn't that nice?

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:50,040
ECMAScript is going to be releasing small incremental changes every year, so it it's easy to stay on

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,250
top of language and avoid scenarios like ES6 where all of these changes were made and people had a hard

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,320
time learning all of them.

37
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,640
Now, with these simple two things in your tool belt,

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,170
go and practice them and see you in the next video.

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,450
Buh-bye.
