00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:10,110
Hello, welcome back to another latest feature of ECMAScript, they keep adding new things, but this

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,670
is a really, really good one.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,990
So the latest one is 20/20, has some really neat features.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,600
And I want to show you some of my favorite ones.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,390
You can see them right here.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,040
Now, in this video, I'm going to talk about the street over here and then later on we'll have separate

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,820
lectures for years, 20, 20 promise all settled and also global this.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,520
So those lectures will be titled East 2020 with the respective names, because these last two are better

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,240
understood once we go over a few different new topics.

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,280
So let's just focus on these three for now.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,310
Let's get started with Big End.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,480
And Big End is a really, really exciting new feature.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,100
It's a new type in JavaScript.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,470
What do I mean by that?

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,700
Well, now in JavaScript we have.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,980
A type of.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,110
Big int.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,640
That's a new type, just like we have no, just like we have Bolian, we have different types in JavaScript.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,730
Well, let's test out that theory.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,720
Let's say we want to find out in our console over here.

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,770
If I do, type of it gives me the type of something, so if I do type of four, it's a number.

22
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,490
If I do type of let's say true, it's a boolean.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,830
But what if I do a type of a really, really large number?

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:04,480
Well, that's still no, you see Big Int stands for Big Integer, but Andre, you just told me that

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,330
Big Ant is a new type and how come I don't see it here?

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,150
Well, to get the biggest type, let's clear this.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,420
You simply add the letter and after a number, so, for example, I can do one, and so if I do type

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,300
of one RN, I get big ENT, but what does that really mean?

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,660
Here's a fun little JavaScript trick or a gotcha.

30
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,620
JavaScript has something called Max Safe Integer, and I'm going to link to some resources in this video

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,190
that if you want to dive deep, you can read about.

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,440
You see, JavaScript has something called a safe number.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,530
And it can go up to a certain Insaaf integer, which is this number right here, but as soon as you

34
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,460
go a little bit higher, the calculations start breaking down.

35
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,950
So if we scroll all the way down here.

36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,160
We find out that the Mac's safe integer has a value of this number.

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,270
The reason behind that number is that JavaScript uses double precision floating point format numbers.

38
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,920
That's a mouthful.

39
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:31,580
Essentially, there's a limit to how much information we can store in memory, what kind of and because

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,200
of the way JavaScript is built.

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,990
And this is actually common with other programming languages as well.

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,150
There's only a certain number that it can hold and big int solves this problem.

43
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,830
So let's experiment here, because I always love when learning a new thing to experiment and make sure

44
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,470
that we truly understand this.

45
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,530
So I'm going to open up the console once again.

46
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:05,450
And I'm going to try something, I'm going to say no dot max safe integer, which gives me the number

47
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,600
that we have here.

48
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,180
So this is the max that we can do in JavaScript.

49
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,850
So what if I do this number?

50
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,240
Plus one, does that work?

51
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,090
Yep, it works.

52
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,550
What if I do this number plus 10?

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,900
Does that work?

54
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,840
No, it doesn't, does it?

55
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,940
This number plus 10 shouldn't equal that, you see how we just broke something?

56
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,060
What if I do this?

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,230
What if I do this?

58
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,560
No, right over here.

59
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
Minus one.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh, boy, it's messed up again.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Again, that doesn't make sense, does it?

62
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,840
So big int is used when we want to use a number that's larger than this max safe integer and we want

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,720
to do some calculations with it.

64
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,970
So instead, if I do this.

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,770
N minus one n.

66
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:20,340
Well, I get an operation between these two big events and you see here that it's working, it's minus

67
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,610
one.

68
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:30,570
Again, if we try and do our Max Integer over here and we do plus 10, we see that this doesn't work

69
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,080
as soon as we add NP to both of these.

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,070
There you go.

71
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,870
Our operations work.

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,740
So we're able to use Big Ent. as a new type.

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,640
Remember, if I clear this and I do.

74
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:55,400
Let's say one end plus two and, well, I get a big into a type of big event that we can do calculations

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,080
on, especially for big numbers.

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,090
But as you can see, we can also just do regular numbers as well as long as we enter.

77
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,360
And pretty, pretty cool most of the time.

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,920
You're not going to use this feature.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,170
But it's nice to know and it's interesting to know that there are these limitations with JavaScript

80
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,910
and big and solves them.

81
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,080
All right.

82
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's learn something even more fun.

83
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,010
Next one is nowish coalescing operator, actually, you know what, let's start with this one first,

84
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,920
the optional chaining operator and then we'll go into the nowish coalescing operator.

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,830
So let's pretend that we're playing Pokemon.

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,510
Hopefully everybody knows Pokemon greatest game as I was growing up.

87
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,870
I think it's still popular, though.

88
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,590
All right, getting sidetracked, let's focus here, let's imagine that we have a user and we'll say

89
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,980
Will Will is a Pokemon trainer and this user.

90
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,120
Has, let's say, the Pokemon, Pikachu and Pikachu.

91
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,220
Is, let's say, a species that is a mouse Pokémon.

92
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,550
It's got a height.

93
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,590
Of zero point four and let's say a wait.

94
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:25,290
Of six pounds, so height zero point four centimeters and six kilograms of weight.

95
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:35,330
Now, let's imagine that we want to find out the weight of Pikachu and hold it in a variable.

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,410
While we would usually do is say let.

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:50,290
Wait, and we'll say within here, we'll do Will Pokémon dot, Pikachu dot, wait.

98
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,850
So if we cancel, let's make this a little bit bigger.

99
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,060
And we'll do wait here.

100
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,440
Let's copy this.

101
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,760
Oh, man, we forgot to come over here, so let's try that again, let's copy this.

102
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,860
And we get wait of six, just to be clear here, I can just say.

103
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,440
All right, so this is working, but here's a problem.

104
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:40,100
Let's say we have a different user and this time the new user, his name is Andre and Andre doesn't

105
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,780
have Pikachu instead Andre has right you.

106
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,430
Again, a different kind of Pokemon.

107
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,820
It's still a mouse Pokemon, but some of the details are different.

108
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,020
Say the height is zero point eight and the weight is 30 kilograms.

109
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,550
So now, if I wanted to find out.

110
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,910
The weight.

111
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,270
Let's say, right, you.

112
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,760
And I run this command.

113
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,930
So let's say now instead of.

114
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:39,120
Right, you listeners do wait to hear, and this time from Andre's Pokemon, we'll do this if I run

115
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,420
this.

116
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,840
I get an error, cannot read property weight of undefined and why is that?

117
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,660
Well, because Andre doesn't have Pikachu, right?

118
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,100
We don't have that Pokemon instead.

119
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,460
We have.

120
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,730
Right.

121
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:05,160
You so when we tried to grab the Pikachu from the Andre Pokémon object, it's going to say, er.
