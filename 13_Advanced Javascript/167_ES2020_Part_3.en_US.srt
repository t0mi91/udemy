00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,690
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,370
Let's talk about.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,860
Knowledge coalescing operator, and it's this double questionmark.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,730
So remember, we learned about the big event and we also learned about the optional training with the

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,380
questionmark and the period just like this.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:23,200
So what's this double questionmark and this double questionmark can often be used instead of what we've

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,450
seen before, the or operator.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,370
So let me show you what I mean.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,220
Let's imagine that we have a new property here and we'll call it power.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,860
And power for Pikachu is.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:55,290
Now, if I wanted to get the power of my Pokémon, then I can simply do this and grab the power or the

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,970
property power lining.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:08,280
But let's say we weren't sure that we had this property for the Pokémon, so we can't really do questionmark

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,250
period because, well, that doesn't really make sense.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,550
Remember, the optional chaining operator works on objects and checking their properties, but power

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,330
is the end of the chain.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,540
We can't really do anything.

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,600
So most of the time what we would do is do an hour operator.

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,630
So if let's say Pikachu doesn't have a power, we can just say no power.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:41,980
So let's imagine here that we have an empty string or maybe not even the property, and if I copy this

21
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,750
over and run this.

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,540
I get no power that makes sense, right?

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,240
But what if we had power in here?

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,850
But it's an empty string.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,570
What would happen then?

26
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,270
Well, if I run this again.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,920
I get no power again.

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:19,620
And that is because this or operator works by checking if this is Truthy, if it's not Truthy, then

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,540
it resorts to no power.

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,310
That's how JavaScript works.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,810
So this empty string evaluates as false and I get no power.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,190
What if the power was false?

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:42,370
Once again, this will resort to force and you'll get no power, but what if we wanted this to be an

34
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,070
empty string instead of no power?

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,150
We want to check if this is no or undefined.

36
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,940
Only then do we want to give no power.

37
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,430
Otherwise, maybe this Pikachu just is still evolving and doesn't have any power.

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,660
But we don't necessarily want to say no power.

39
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,780
Well, in that case, we can do the knowledge coalescing.

40
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,560
And this instead of the OR operator doesn't check if a value is falsey.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,660
Instead, it checks if it's null or undefined.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,210
So things like zero, for example.

43
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,550
If we do that, well, let's find out.

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,460
If I copy this, I get power of zero.

45
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,470
If this was an or.

46
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,530
In that case, the result would be different.

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,240
The result would be no power, even though we actually have a value.

48
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,080
So, again, knowledge coalescing is really, really useful for those occasions that you might use the

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,140
or operator.

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,990
Pretty, pretty cool.

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,980
All right.

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,350
I think that's enough.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,730
There's a few more to cover with 20.

54
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,150
But again, we're going to encounter those throughout the rest of the sections because they require

55
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,940
a bit of other knowledge that we're going to accumulate.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,090
So let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.
