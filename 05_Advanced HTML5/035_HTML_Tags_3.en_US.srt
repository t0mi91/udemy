00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,220
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,520
I'm excited to show you a few more tags, before we get into some fun things, that we can do with HTML

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,090
now and we can finish up the course.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:20,370
You may be wondering, hey! what if maybe, I'm working with a team and we're all working on the same HTML

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:30,850
file and I want to, maybe, have a comment in there, to let them know that maybe, here "Use GET, not POST"

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,750
Let's, capitalize it, if we just do this the way it is.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,230
It's kind of, show up on the Web site, we just want it as a comment, so that people who look at the code

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,910
can see it without affecting the website.

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:55,300
Well, HTML has a way to comment and the way you do that, is like this

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,210
"Use GET, not POST"

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,230
Now, that's kind of tedious to write. In sublime text, you can do that by holding 'COMMAND + /'

12
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:17,310
and you can do it that way. If you have a Windows based laptop or computer, that is the 'CTRL + /'

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,030
*/ Not 'windows + /' /*

14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,470
So that's how, we write comments.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,640
And if I save this. Oops that's not what I wanted to do.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,940
If I save this and refresh, nothing shows up.

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,680
Perfect.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:41,800
And then, the last two tags that I'm going to show you, are the ‘div’ tags for division and the ‘span’ tags

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,390
these tags are,

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
how can I say this, useless right now.

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,280
And it's because they're used to divide content.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:04,500
So ‘div’ tag, you're going to see in a lot of web pages, are used like this, to let's say, wrap the form.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,610
So by doing this, let's see if it does anything.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,370
Nope!, everything looks exact same, but this is very powerful when we get into CSS.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,730
Because what this allows us to do, is to divide up our content.

26
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,460
Imagine if we had a registration form here, maybe another piece of content, maybe an image up here.

27
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:36,640
‘div’ tag allows us to add styles and divide up the content into each different section, so that, each section

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,960
of our Web site, can have its own little box.

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,480
So you're going to see this a lot, in the CSS section.

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,600
But for now just keep that in mind, so there's no surprises.

31
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:58,990
‘span’ tag is the same thing except, ‘span’ tag is a inline element, so an inline element is different from a block

32
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:10,980
element because with ,’span’ tag we can just add it to a specific line, so we can do ‘span’ and ‘/span’.

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,520
And again, this won't do anything, if I refresh.

34
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,720
Nothing happens.

35
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:25,020
But now inline, we can add some styles only to the "First Name:" and we can emphasize it, so these are

36
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:32,020
just tags that we can use as tools, when we want to have a container, an invisible container, around a

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,850
piece of element and are HTML.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,450
that perhaps you want to add some style to or have some specific functionality to.

39
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,920
So again, we're not going to worry about adding these, to our current web site, but I wanted to show you

40
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,110
that those do exist and we're going to encounter those

41
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,060
in the CSS chapter.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,570
That's it for now.

43
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,440
Talk to you soon.
