If you want to practice your HTML skills even more, <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>here is a great free resource</strong></a> for you to&nbsp;use.</p><p>You can complete all of the interactive exercises in the link above,&nbsp;however, I do want to caution you:<strong> the best way to become a successful web developer isn't about just focusing on HTML&nbsp;for a long time&nbsp;until you have it perfect before you move onto the next topic (CSS).</strong> The best thing you can do, is to use the current knowledge that you have&nbsp;to move onto the next section, as you will be constantly improving and learning new things about HTML as you code along in this course. </p><p>Spending all of your time learning and memorizing all of the html tags and attributes is not the most efficient use of your time. Most job interviews of a web developer will never test this knowledge. <strong>What you want to do instead is this</strong>: Understand how you can use HTML, and how to use online resources to find html tags and attributes that you need.&nbsp;A great developer is someone who knows how to find solution to problems and knows where to look.&nbsp;No&nbsp;developer can memorize everything, especially when we start learning CSS&nbsp;and Javascript.&nbsp;</p><p>As we progress through the course we will constantly be using the knowledge in this section to build bigger and better web applications.</p><p><strong>If you take one thing from this, it is this:</strong> Don't worry if you don't feel 100% confident in HTML. Keep going as we will keep building on top of this knowledge.</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
