1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,730
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,190
We're going to get into some more advanced tags and probably the most important tag that you'll use, other than

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:16,910
the ones that we've covered so far, are tags that we need, to create forms. As you know, when you go to

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,570
Web sites usually there's some sort of a login or registration form, so we're going to build that

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,660
out today. To get started, let's just create a new file here.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,110
We'll save it and call it "register.html"

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:42,280
on our desktop. Perfect. And we know that we want an "html". So we can use our little shortcut and we'll title

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,890
it "Register".

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:56,240
Save that and now in the "index.html" file, let's add another link that references "register.html" and

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,290
I'll just say here,

11
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,920
"Register" right.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,370
We'll save both of these files and let's refresh.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,340
We have "Register". click "Register", while we have nothing yet, but it looks like it's working.

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,400
Let's add this on a new line, just because it looks prettier that way.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,640
So to do that, if you remember we're going to add a break ‘br’ tag.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,030
So let's refresh.

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,670
There you go.

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,940
We have "new page" and "register".

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,240
OK.

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:34,350
So let's build out this form. If you go into "register.html", the way we write forms in HTML.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,560
Well conveniently there is a ‘form’ tag.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,050
OK. But this ‘form’ tag itself needs to have the actual form inside of it.

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,970
So what kind of form elements do we have?

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:55,710
Well, again if we remember our good old friend "W3C", lets type in "w3c forms".

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,440
And we can see over here, that we have HTML forms and refresh.

26
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:10,380
We'll make that full screen and you can see over here that, there is a ton of information on it, but you

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,790
can look that up yourself, for now.

28
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm going to introduce you to the most common ones, probably the ones that you'll use 90 percent of the

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,780
time.

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,090
The first one as we do with any form.

31
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,550
And let's go to that page for now, is well we want to enter our name.

32
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,350
So how do we do that?

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:39,800
We have a ‘input’ tag, that has a 'type' of "text", because well our name will be in "text" form and we can

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,660
close that off and it's actually a self closing tag.

35
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,070
So now, if I save and hit refresh. OK. we have a little box here.

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,460
Hopefully you can see that.

37
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,880
But, well we should probably title it, because we won't know what to enter that way. so we're going to

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:05,180
put in here, we're going to say "First Name:" and save. let's refresh. We have first name.

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,590
And now. let's make this a little bit bigger.

40
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,240
There you go.

41
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,450
Now, you can enter your name in here. Awesome.

42
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,240
Well let's add another one for "Last Name:".

43
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,340
And again we'll have, our "input type".

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,990
So that's an attribute and a value of 'text'.

45
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,990
And if we refresh, we have "Last Name".

46
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,720
OK.

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,490
But, it kinda looks ugly. remember that HTML, just reads line by line and doesn't really know

48
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:51,730
that we want a space here, so again, we can add a break ‘br’ tag here and refresh and we have first name and

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,550
last name.

50
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:53,960
OK.

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,920
That's, that's fairly self-explanatory.

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,670
Now, what else do we have in a form? we have e-mail.

53
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,460
So let's let's add another field, which is "Email:".

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:15,530
And we'll do input again, type equals text, we'll add another ‘br’ here because we're going to need that spacing

55
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,940
and let's save. refresh.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:27,980
Awesome. OK so we have our general registration form and obviously with any form, we need some sort of

57
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,560
buttons.

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,800
Like, we need to submit this somewhere, so we can register.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,830
Well, again there's a nice input type for that.

60
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,300
So we do input, instead of a text type,

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:53,790
there is a "submit" type. So this, if we add another break in here and I save this. I refresh. It has a submit

62
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,340
button now.

63
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,760
Now, where did this "submit" come from.

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,500
Well, when you put an input type "submit" it automatically creates a button.

65
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,510
And if you don't specify what to say, It'll just have this text.

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,110
But, we can change that, so we can put value and we'll put.

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,260
"Register".

68
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,970
Save that. refresh.

69
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:29,740
We now have a "Register!" button. ok. But what if, we make mistakes in this field, we write stuff and what we

70
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,340
want to reset this form. Again there's another input for that.

71
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,040
And the type of that input as you can imagine is "reset".

72
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,530
So now, if we close this. Add another break tag in here. actually we can keep that on the same line. we'll save.

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,580
refresh. and we have "Reset".

74
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,840
So now if I type in anything in here and let's say I don't want to.

75
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,110
Well, I don't like this, I need to reset the form.

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,500
I can just click "Reset" and it clears everything for us.

77
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,640
OK.

78
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,150
You may be asking yourself, "You know what,

79
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,410
well, what happens when we click 'Register’?", before we get into that,

80
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,850
I want to just go through all the common input types and then we'll click "Register" to see what happens.

81
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,420
With the e-mail,

82
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,610
we ideally want, first of all for it to be required, so that when you click register if you haven't provided

83
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,550
an email, it won't let you register.

84
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,770
And there's an attribute that, we can use for that and that is "required".

85
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:41,290
And here we don't actually have to specify a value, because automatically it's assumed that required

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,150
equals to true, which means that this form field is required.

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:55,770
So if I save that. I refresh. And I leave it blank and I click register. It'll say please fill out, this field.

88
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,130
Now, we also want to make sure that, it's an appropriate e-mail field.

89
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:06,200
So if I type something like this. we still want to make sure that, you know, this is an incorrect e-mail.

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
We don't want to register.

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,400
So the input type of text that I told you for email, is actually wrong.

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,140
There's a specific one that we can use, which is, as you can imagine, "email".

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:26,980
So now if I refresh and type in something that's not an email and I click register. I'll say please include

94
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,780
an "@" in the email address. Very nice.

95
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,150
It's kind of like magic. it does this for you, which is very very nice.

96
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,450
Let's expand on our knowledge, of inputs and add a few more fields, that we'll most likely need.

97
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,410
Usually, want to know somebody's birthday.

98
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:52,830
So lets, add birthday here and for this input type let's do type "date".

99
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:04,650
so if I save this and I refresh. Look at that, we have a nice little date picker, so I can pick anything in

100
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,060
here.

101
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,860
All right.

102
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,860
What else do we need.

103
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,230
We also need "Gender".

104
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,730
So we'll do input.

105
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,320
type and for gender,

106
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,730
Well there's no specific input type for gender. but there is something called 'radio' and radio is as the name

107
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,500
suggest radio buttons.

108
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,450
So now, I click refresh.

109
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:35,060
And well, I have one radio button, but we ideally want to have options right, so how do we do that.

110
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:43,250
So for the radio, we also need to say, whether it's male or female, let's have within the gender.

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:54,460
We're going to have a break tag over here in the line and we'll say input type "radio" and we'll say "Male"

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,420
and we also want "Female" and we also want "Other"

113
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,560
and when we refresh this, we have "Male", "Female" and "Other".

114
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,740
But you see a problem here, I just click the radio buttons and I can't de-select them and ideally, you

115
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,030
can only - you should only be able to select one.

116
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,830
And right now the way, the radio buttons are, they don't know of each others existance, we want to make sure

117
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,060
that, they know that they're connected. They're family and only one of them can be picked.

118
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,230
So how do we do that. The way we do that is, through the "name" attribute.

119
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:47,600
So for the name we'll say "gender" and this name attribute, needs to match on all the radio buttons. so

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:56,600
that they know, they are together, they're part of the "gender" input field. So if I save here and refresh

121
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,690
Now, you can see that I can only select one.

122
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,110
All right.

123
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,830
Perfect.

124
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,500
What else should we have.

125
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,090
Well lets say, what I really want to know if you have pets. So with pets.

126
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:24,660
We're going to have "input" "type". We can have multiple pets, so it won't be radio buttons. We want 'checkbox'.

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,660
So checkbox.

128
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:35,380
We want it to have cats, or let's just put "Cat".  and we want to have

129
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,650
- can't type today.

130
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,870
Check box and we want to have "Dogs".

131
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,260
So let's save that.

132
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,090
Let's refresh and look at that.

133
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:58,030
We have "Pets". But this time, it's checkboxes which means, I can select multiple.
