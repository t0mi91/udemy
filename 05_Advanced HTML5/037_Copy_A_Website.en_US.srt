Good afternoon! to you, not just Andrei.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,590
This is a fun little video.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,320
I like to throw, some of these, every once in a while because I know, it can get very exhausting, when you

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,350
have a lot of information thrown at you.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,830
So I want us to copy a Website, really really fast.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,550
Let's, look at how we can do that.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,200
One of my favorite websites is

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,640
'waitbutwhy.com'.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,580
Ooh It's all caps! I don't know why I did that, but it should still work.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,810
If you haven't checked out this website.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,810
I highly recommend it.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,670
Some great great articles on here.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,860
But let's say, I look at this website.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm like hmm, this is really really cool.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,270
I wish I could play around with it.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:49,530
Well before I showed you, View, Developer, Developer Tools, and we had a nice little pop up

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,130
at the bottom of the screen.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:00,170
This time I want to show you, "View Source" when you click on that, Oh boy! you get a whole bunch of stuff.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,430
But if you look at the top of it here, you see that it's "DOCTYPE HTML", is just simple HTML.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,500
And this might look, really really overwhelming.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,500
Don't worry.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,850
This will make sense to you at the end, but you can see over here that, they're commenting this out,

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,160
There is the 'html' tag.

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:26,480
And if you scroll down there's a whole lot of stuff, but simply by copying all this, so I can just select

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:36,240
all and copy this and if I open up Sublime. There you go and let's just open up, a new file over here

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,920
and copy and paste this.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,240
Oh that's a lot of stuff.

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm going to save with 'Save As' and we'll call it

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,690
'waitbutwhy.html'

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,770
All right.

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,120
Save it.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,030
And now, if I go to my desktop

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,990
and I have 'waitbutwhy.html', if I drag it into */Oops I can't grab it/* if I drag it into my Google Chrome

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,640
look at that.

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,350
I have 'waitbutwhy', all to myself.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,470
And I can play around with it and break it and do whatever I want.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,060
I can even see what they use to create these little post thing-a-dingies.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,050
But, a really really fun way, to play around with websites.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,870
Hope that was interesting, see you in the next one. Bye-bye
