1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:09,050
I want to introduce you to one last form element and it's actually not an input with a type, as we've

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,370
described before, it's a little bit different. but the idea is still the same.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:23,780
So let's add "Cars:" here and we want this to be a drop-down menu. Again, something that we see very often

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,480
in form fields.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:35,580
However, unlike an input tag, we have to do a ‘select’ tag, needs a ‘/select’ tag as well.

6
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,090
And within here, we can put in our options.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:51,480
So the option will be, will have a value of "volvo" not "volco" and we'll say "Volvo" because we want that

8
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,010
actually printed to the screen.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,980
And again we have to close that tag. We'll add

10
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,200
"Audi"

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,170
and we'll close that tag as well and we can keep adding them.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,020
But for now, just two is fine.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,380
If I save this and I refresh, we have cars, let's add a ‘br’ tag here.

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,360
Just so it looks nicer.

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,920
There you go.

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,050
And here now, we have a dropdown menu.

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's say you want to extend this or you want to see what kind of properties, you can put with select

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,680
the way you go about it.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,990
As you know we've done this before, we type in "html select tag" and actually Google gives you a nice little

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,540
info page over here with attributes, so you can see over here, we can use "multiple", which is "specifies

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,590
that multiple options can be selected at once".

22
00:01:50,630 --> 00:02:04,440
So, let's do that, let's let's minimize this. perfect. and within select, we'll put "multiple". we refresh, and

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,430
we can actually select multiple elements.

24
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,740
But that doesn't look that pretty. So I'm going to take that out [deletes "multiple" from ‘select’ tag] and refresh.

25
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,010
I actually realized that, we forgot one important input type. So I'm going to throw it in there as a

26
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,610
bonus.

27
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,280
And as you know with any registration form we want a password.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,030
So let's add that right after the email.

29
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,190
We'll do.

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,340
input

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:44,610
type and yes there is a "password" type that we can add and this "password" type will have another attribute

32
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:52,720
that's kind of cool and that is "min", which is how many, the minimum characters that a password needs.

33
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,290
Ok. So let's, save that, refresh and let's add a ‘br’ tag here.

34
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,140
So, it looks pretty, refresh.

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,350
And now the password field, look at that, it acts like a password field.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,080
All right.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,150
Let's submit this form and see what happens.
