1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,220
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,320
Whenever you have a request from an employer to build a website or a web app one of the first things

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,590
that they will ask for is to make sure that your Web site is responsive.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,640
So what is responsive UI.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,700
Well I can show you by opening up the developer tools which we should know by now and you'll see over

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,700
here that there is a little phone icon.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,860
If we click on this go we'll show you why your Web site will look like on say an iPhone.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,350
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,450
So let's do 100 percent of the size.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,590
Perfect.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,540
You'll see that your Web site on an iPhone looks like this.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,600
And if we do a night bad well it looks like this and if it rotates it looks good so responsive means

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,570
that your Web site no matter what whether it's on the big screen or something like a notepad it is responsive.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,730
That means there's no cut offs.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,440
Everything looks good no matter what size the screen is.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,400
So if we go back to our Web site and close the developer tabs I can actually play around with this open

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,710
and close and see that it's responsive.

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,520
The Web site looks good no matter what the size and users can enjoy the experience and not be turned

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,180
off because whether they're accessing it through their eye bad at home on their couch it still looks

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,020
good.

21
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,150
So keep that in mind.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,970
Responsive UI should be a priority when building Web sites.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,590
I'll see in the next one probably.
