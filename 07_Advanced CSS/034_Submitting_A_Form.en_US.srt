1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,340
OK! OK! Andrei, can we finally submit this form?!

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:04,710
All right.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,580
And this video will finally see, what happens when we submit this form?

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,910
But, there is one last thing, that we need to include and that is the "name" attributes.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,420
And then I'll explain.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,980
Towards the end of this video, why we need those.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:28,850
So we want to add, in each one of our fields, a "name" attribute. So this one will be "firstname" and I'm just

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,800
going to copy and paste here, just so it'll be a little bit faster.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:46,700
We have "lastname", "email", "password", "birthday" and we already have these four, the radio buttons, which is good.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,090
And we need here "cat", "dog".

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,680
"volvo", "audi" */It's "audi" not "volvo"/*.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,310
Okay. Now we don't need it for the buttons, because well there's no user information there.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,970
So, I'm going to save that and I'm going to make this full screen, so you can see, I'm going to refresh

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,450
the page and let's enter some fake data and see what happens.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:21,610
So I'm going to say "fake", "man", e-mail address is fake password will be "123", birthday, "male", with

16
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,620
a "cat" and has an "audi".

17
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,550
I'm going to click "Register!" now, but keep an eye out.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,460
Up over here.

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,320
To See what happens, when I click. Did you catch that?!

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:43,130
Let's copy this, because when I clicked "Register!", this got attached. I am going to minimize this and print

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,280
this out here, so we can see it for ourselves.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,300
First we have a question mark, then.

23
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,880
First name "fake".

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,130
That's exactly what we entered.

25
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,450
We have last name "man".

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,240
Email is 

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,010
"fake something something gmail dot com"

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,360
password "123". Uh oh

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:11,810
They know our password, birthday, gender, and Cat "on". we didn't, didn't select "volvo".

30
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,820
Not sure why? I'll take a look at that later.

31
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:22,450
But, you can see over here, that the values that we entered, into our form were just attached

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,700
to this link.

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,090
And this is actually called query strings and what it is.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,540
It's one way for us, to send our information to the backend or the servers, beca use we have to store this

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,520
form information somewhere, so that when we come back onto this page, the Web site remembers us.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:51,620
This was automatically generated in HTML5, with a form. But form was using an attribute called

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,200
"GET" and this "GET".

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,670
If I left it as this, will do the exact same thing, where it will attach the form information to the URL

39
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,300
and send it to the server.

40
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,810
There is another option, where you can do "POST" and you can try it on your own here, but you wouldn't

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,290
see any query parameters.

42
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,450
So this wouldn't change, the bar at the top won't change and that is because, it will be attached to the

43
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,710
body of the request, which we'll get into, when we get to that section.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,110
I don't want to confuse you too much, but you can see the difference here, of why we might want to use

45
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,480
"POST" instead of "GET" because well, what if somebody was over my shoulder and they can see my password

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,980
right there in the bar.

47
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,950
I just want you, to get comfortable with the idea that, we are sending this information to the backend

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,850
the way we handle that.

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,030
We'll get into, later on in the course.

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,170
Right now, we're just focusing on the front end.

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,830
The last thing I want to show you was, that form also has a "action" attribute, which used to get used a

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:08,120
lot, if you saw old PHP based web sites, they will have, some sort of "action.php" which said, submit

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,750
this form.

54
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:17,380
And when you submit this form, to the backend, to the server, run this script this file, that's on the server.

55
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,530
But there are better ways of doing this now, so I'll show that later on

56
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,100
in the course

57
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,240
let's, take a look at this.

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,500
So we have a question mark and this is the standard, Any time there's a query string, so we're adding

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,210
a piece of data to our URL.

60
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,820
It starts off, with a question mark which states, Hey! coming up, we're going to have a bunch of data for

61
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,490
you.

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,750
The first one is "firstname", which again corresponds with the name, that we have in our form.

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,330
And that was equal to "fake".

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,450
So that's "property" and "value".

65
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:10,440
So, you can think of "name" as "property" and the "value" as "man" so, 'lastname' 'firstname', you can see here, that

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,580
there's an "&" sign.

67
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,980
So that's again saying, 'firstname' equals to 'fake' and 'lastname' equals to 'man'.

68
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,200
And 'email' equals to 'fake some jibberish.

69
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,290
Gmail dot com'.

70
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,130
So this is because of something called the URL encoding.

71
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:33,990
And because the URL has special meaning for some characters, such as this and the 'questionmark'. It encodes

72
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,670
the "@" sign with something, that it understands but it won't affect its encoding.

73
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:52,170
We have 'password' '123', 'birthday', 'gender' 'on' and 'cat' 'on' and I've actually realized, why the 'volvo' and 'audi'

74
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,530
information didn't register and that is because for the query string to work, as you can see it needs

75
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,540
to have a name associated with the value, so we have 'firstname' and 'fake'.

76
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:11,840
If we look at the radio buttons, we have a 'name' which is 'gender' and we have 'on'

77
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,730
So you see over here, how we didn't send, any value.

78
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,570
We know that the gender, some button was clicked, and the gender.

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:30,920
So it's on, but we don't know, which value and that is because, we should have included a "value" for the

80
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,250
"male" so that, if that's the one that is selected, a 'value' will be sent.

81
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:50,780
And finally value and now same with the select. We should have had our "name" of the select field, the "cars"

82
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,790
so that now the "name", can be associated with the value.

83
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,470
So let's give that a try, one more time.

84
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,710
I'm going to delete this.

85
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm going to save, the changes that we just made.

86
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,030
I am going to make this full screen, let's refresh and enter some new information.

87
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:22,950
'Fake', 'new', e-mail is 'newfake@gmail.com', password is '1234' this time.

88
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,000
Birthday.

89
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:36,850
Let's do 'female', 'dog' and 'audi' and then I click "Register!". And let's see, what we have here.

90
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:46,280
We have 'firstname' 'fake', 'lastname' is 'new', 'email' 'newfake@gmail.com', 'password' '1234', 'birthday', 'gender' is

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,350
'female'.

92
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,130
Good. 'dog' is 'on'.

93
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,410
OK.

94
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,140
So we've selected dog, that's great.

95
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,560
And then cars is 'audi'.

96
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,240
There you go.

97
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,510
And that's as complicated, as forms are going to get.

98
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,300
You'll encounter this a lot and there is definitely in most websites, that you build whether it's a landing

99
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,820
page, a Web site that requires registration.

100
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,020
This is something that, you'll see a lot. Once you understand this, once it makes sense.

101
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,090
You know, you can call yourself an HTML developer.

102
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,240
So I'll see you in the next one.

103
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,770
Bye bye
