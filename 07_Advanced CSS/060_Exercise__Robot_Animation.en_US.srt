Hello.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,650
This is your new robot friend and I have a fun little challenge for you.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,070
I've created this robot that is actually pretty cool.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:18,210
So as you hover his head grows big and he can also dance.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,650
Now here's the challenge I've created majority of this robot.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,550
But you first need to assemble it.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,340
So it looks like this.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,540
I've left a few files for you.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,360
An index file and a CSX file.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,510
The only problem is that these parts are all over the page and I need you to assemble them so that you

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,250
can have a robot friend as well in the following section.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,150
After the exercise I'll have the solution that you can use but give it a try and hopefully you'll have

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,140
a new robot friend to.
