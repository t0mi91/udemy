1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,470
Wow! good job for still hanging in there.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,420
It only gets more and more exciting from here, we're just scratching the surface with the power that

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,650
comes, with being a web developer.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,310
But I want to quickly talk about HTML vs HTML5.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,550
I've mentioned this topic a few times, but just kind of brushed it off and told you, yeah this is HTML

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,960
Yeah this is HTML5.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:33,290
But I wanted to just take a break and quickly go over the basic concept, of what HTML5 is?

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:44,270
If you remember in our diagram, HTML, when it first, got started in 1989 to 1991, it wasn't as elaborate.

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,880
It didn't have as many features, as it has now.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:55,340
We want to make sure that, all these browsers play nicely and understand, our HTML rules.

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:02,300
So if you remember, our friend Tim, our first web developer, the guy who created the world wide web, has

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,380
a governing body, that establishes what HTML should look like, so that these individual browsers know

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,850
how to code their browser, so that it reads HTML properly.

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,610
And obviously the web that we had in the 90s, is very different than the one, that we have now.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:25,860
So there's a lot of new things that, we need to update and some of those things are.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,930
You know we have phones and we have tablets and just overall, we need more power from HTML.

17
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:43,130
So, HTML5 was the evolution and there's, there are many many evolutions of HTML, HTML5 is the latest

18
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,230
one, where we try to add on features so that, we can improve the user experience.

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,650
Now, what are some of those features?

20
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,630
Let's take a quick look, at our good old friend, W3 schools.

21
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,960
One of the things that HTML5 wants to do is, well we want to make sure that it doesn't affect

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,460
any old web site, if you remember our very first web site from Tim, maybe in 1991.

23
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,720
Well, that still works to this day, we visited it in the previous videos.

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,420
You can still visit Web sites from the 90s, because we want to make sure that everything is backwards

25
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,110
compatible.

26
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,880
That's a fancy way of saying, older versions are not obsolete.

27
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,390
But we also want to tack on these features and you can read on the Web site, all the information of HTML5

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,880
and what it does and some of the things that it supports and it does get a little technical and

29
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,860
we don't need to get into it, too much.

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,630
But the one thing that I want to emphasize that, it introduced this idea of semantic elements and what

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:59,370
that means is, they wanted to make Web sites more descriptive, search engines such as Google, go on websites

32
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,570
and they use these things called crawlers, to look through your Web site.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,850
These machines, that are reading your HTML, to understand what your web site is?, what the topic about

34
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:17,370
it is?, so that they can rank it in search engines and HTML5 semantic elements, tries to add a little

35
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,690
bit more meaning for these robots, so that when they encounter something, it makes a little bit more sense.

36
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,360
So, this is an example, of some of these new tags, that HTML5 introduced.

37
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,430
And let's show you a few of them.

38
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,410
For example, if we wanted to say, that we want to comment this out, we know how to do that already.

39
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:50,070
And a semantic element, would maybe look like ‘header’ where we have the title ‘h1’ which is "Register"

40
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,290
and we close the ‘/header’ so that now, the crawler knows that, this is our header and maybe we have some

41
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,010
navigation ‘nav’ links.

42
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:12,130
So now, we can have ’a’ tags with our 'href' and we'll just say that, it links to Google and then we close

43
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,710
the ‘nav’.

44
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,430
We only have one navigation link for now,  but I just wanted to demonstrate quickly.

45
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:32,670
And finally we have a ‘footer’, so within the ‘footer’, we can add something like "Website made with love".

46
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:41,410
and you can see over here that, this even to a machine, if it understands what ‘header’ means, and ‘nav’ means,

47
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:48,580
and ‘footer’ means, gives a lot more meaning to the web page and it'll have a better idea of, how the website

48
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,030
is structured and where it's their rank and their Google search results. You can take your time and read

49
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,580
through some of these tags.

50
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:03,250
And I do recommend that, you visit this Web site and go through some of the HTML intro, you'll even

51
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,830
see that, if we click on ‘input’ types or something that we visited already and we scroll to some of the

52
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:16,600
attributes, you'll see that there some new HTML5, they have these little icon over here, that have

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,130
been introduced, so we're constantly expanding to make HTML better and better functionality.

54
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,230
You can see here 'min', for example, we use that for password, if you remember, specifies the minimum value

55
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,040
for an input field.

56
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:40,840
So if I set a 'min' over here, then it make sure that, I enter the minimum amount of value.

57
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,840
But again, you can take a look at it yourself.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,880
The issue with semantic web is, that it's still fairly new.

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:06:01,090
So you won't see as much, of this, you will on some Web sites, but it's very hard to prove that it actually

60
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,540
has good SEO performance because it's still fairly early, but just so you don't get surprised and you're

61
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,310
aware of what's happening.

62
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:18,000
It is something that you might encounter, but overall HTML5 tries to, improve the performance of

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
the web , because we're constantly evolving.

64
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:29,160
And just like Web sites, need to go from simple HTML text based Web site to massive web sites like

65
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:36,630
Twitter, that you can post and talk to millions of people around the world, where we need our web technologies

66
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,220
to evolve with us.

67
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,890
I'll see you in the next one. Bye Bye
