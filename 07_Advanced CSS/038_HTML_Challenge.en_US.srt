00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,580
Phew! Can you believe you've made it, this far?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,090
I mean at the beginning of this, you probably had no idea, what any of this means and now look at you, you know

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,680
what every single line means.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,390
You know what.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,120
This is pretty much it, for HTML.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,660
It's not very hard.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,000
You just have to remember a few tags and it's very easy to test around and play.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,460
So call yourself an HTML developer!

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,430
I have a fun little game for you, as you can see over here, we've created a simple web page, where I can

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,830
link to another page.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,110
I can go back, I can even click on register and submit a form.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,580
I want you to try your hand at building your own little website here.

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,300
And once you're done, I'll provide the link to my email in the description below.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:05,260
Send me your first web site and I'll showcase some of my favorite ones, in an upcoming video.

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,570
I'll see you in the next one.

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,050
Bye-bye
