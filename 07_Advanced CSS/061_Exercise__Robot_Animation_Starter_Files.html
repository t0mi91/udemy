But he needs some assembly first! Using everything you learned in this section, and your best friend: <strong>Google Developer Tools in the browser</strong>, try to assemble your new robot friend.&nbsp;<br><br>If you get stuck, in the next lecture, you will find my solution&nbsp;<em>(but remember that there are many solutions to this layout problem).</em><br><br>Once you are done, customize your robot, and add any animation you want. Then, you can submit it to our Discord in the <strong>#css</strong>&nbsp;channel for myself and others to view!&nbsp;You can send&nbsp;your CSS and HTML5 files or screen capture your robot. But the best way is through <a href="https://codepen.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/</a>&nbsp;<br><br>PS -&nbsp;if you have any questions,&nbsp;reach out to our student community in the<strong>&nbsp;#css</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>#helpme</strong>&nbsp;channel on Discord (Lecture 2 provides the link if you have not yet joined)!<br><br>Good luck!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
