00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:09,700
In this video we're going to be talking about CSX three now just like with a CML in 80 mile five.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:20,540
CSX is a standard that constantly evolves to adapt to new demands of Web sites so CSX 3 is the latest

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:29,690
evolution of CSX where we've added new properties and new features so that we can make our design even

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,720
better.

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:38,840
So if you remember in our diagram over here all these browsers have different developers different teams

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,870
that work on implementing their features.

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:51,380
Now in an ideal world everybody agrees on what CSX does and when new features and new properties are

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,220
added.

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,680
Everybody implements them at the same time but that's simply not the case.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,770
Some browsers might work with some property.

12
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,360
Some might not because they haven't gotten around to making it work.

13
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,740
So let's go back to our Web site now.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,160
Let's play with one of my favorite CSX three properties.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,680
How cool would it be if when we hover over these pictures the picture moves well with CSX three they've

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,620
introduced something called transition.

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,200
And if I do all one second and I'll explain to what that does in one second image hover.

18
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,200
So this should be familiar where when we hover we want the image to transform.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,180
This is a new property as well.

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,270
And we'll say scale one point one.

21
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,910
So let's see what happens.

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:55,610
I refresh look at that my images are now moving on hover.

23
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,770
Is that cool.

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:04,530
What these properties do is say that I want the image to transition when an action is taken upon it.

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,730
And I want all the properties to transition over one second And what's that transition going to be.

26
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,380
Well when I hover I wanted to transform by a scale of one point one.

27
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,560
So it's essentially growing.

28
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,220
If I change this to four seconds and I refresh.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,240
Well now takes four seconds for the image to scale.

30
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,330
You can see over here.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm going to change this back to one second just because it looks better that way.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,770
If I make this website full screen you see that we now have a beautiful effect for our image gallery.

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,990
There's also another property called animation which you can look at on your own.

34
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,580
But again CSX tree has brought in a lot of these new properties to make Web sites even more dynamic

35
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,020
than they are now.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:07,350
But there is a little caveat to using such properties and that is you want to make sure that each browser

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:16,830
has implemented a new feature so if I go to one of our favorite Web sites w schools they have a CSX

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,480
browser support reference and here you can look at all the CSX to make sure that browsers support whatever

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,300
property you want to use.

40
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:35,250
So if we go to transition we see that it is supported by all latest browsers but you also see that if

41
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,420
we go to something like a user select they have this M.S. Moore's Web kids line over it.

42
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,960
And if we scroll all the way down we'll show you that it is supported by Internet Explorer with prefix

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,710
M.S..

44
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,090
What does that mean.

45
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,590
Well these are browser prefixes and you'll see them every once in a while.

46
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,010
What it is is these are new features of CSX that haven't fully been implemented by the browsers and

47
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,270
you want to use a prefix to make sure that they work as an experimental feature in the browser.

48
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,300
Let me explain what that means if I wanted to add a let's say a box shadow Suzanne means kind of making

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,090
this look 3-D and having a shadow underneath the edge over here.

50
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:32,840
Previously I had to do something like this where I put box shadow and you can read into the property

51
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,870
to see what I'm about to do but I'm going to do four pixels four pixels five pixels and then the color

52
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,510
which is a bit of a gray.

53
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:51,500
So if I do this and refresh Well now it looks nice and my browser is the new chrome so it has this feature

54
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:01,870
but a few years ago when box shadow was first introduced you had to do something like this box shadow

55
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:12,010
then copy and paste this and this makes sure that it works on the Mozilla browser.

56
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:24,500
And then you also had and this which made sure that it works on Internet Explorer you had Web Kit which

57
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,810
made sure that it works on safari and chrome.

58
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:39,100
And then finally you also had oh which made it work on the Opera browser and then you also had to still

59
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,570
mention the box shadow without the prefix is at the bottom.

60
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:52,480
So now if any of these browsers don't support box shadow well they have these prefixes so that it should

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,420
work and book Shadow has been some time now so you don't need to do this anymore.

62
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,870
But there is one great way of seeing if a certain property still needs browser prefixes and that is

63
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,620
using something like this reference which I will leave for you so you can check it out.

64
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,380
Another thing I wanted to show you is can I use.

65
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,960
So can I use dot com.

66
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,720
He is a great resource to see any thing that you might want to try out.

67
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:30,900
So if I type in here a CSX transition you'll see CSX three transitions are supported in all these browsers

68
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,780
except we have one Opera Mini.

69
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,130
And it says it's two point sixty three percent of the global usage.

70
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,060
So if you use CSX three transitions two point sixty three percent of population might not be able to

71
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,720
see it.

72
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,230
Now whether that is your user base or not you can kind of decide what the tradeoffs are.

73
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,860
But this is a great thing to use and if we use something like flex box while we see that flex box has

74
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,600
all support it shouldn't be a problem for you to use it.

75
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:14,130
OK let's go back to this and just finish up this Web site to make it look nice so I don't like that

76
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,150
there's space here ideally.

77
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:24,480
This is all the way to the left but if I do margin 0 pixels and I refresh that actually doesn't change

78
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,390
much because sometimes browsers have their own default margins.

79
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:36,770
So the way to get around it is to do margin zero for the body.

80
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,810
So margin 0 pixels let's save and refresh.

81
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,660
Perfect.

82
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,630
Now we have this all the way to the left.

83
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,040
OK.

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:55,980
But we do want a bit of a buffer at the top so I'm going to add margin top and we'll do 10 pixels save

85
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,600
and refresh.

86
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,590
Perfect.

87
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,100
Now we have a beautiful Web site and it didn't really take us much.

88
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:13,070
We just wrote a few lines of CSX a few lines of 80 email and because we have let's see in the next one

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:13,860
by.
