1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,320
Lou let's build a fun image portfolio site.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:12,580
One of the biggest problems that people have and the hardest problems to assess it's always making sure

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,470
that we have our items displayed in the location that we want.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,320
That is a really really difficult problem.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,280
And there are many many solutions to this problem but one of the new ways and now is probably the most

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:34,040
popular way is called flex box and we're gonna be using that to create a beautiful image Web site.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,510
Let's get started.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:42,430
So I have an indexation mollified here and a style that's the SS file in the same directory on my desktop

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,190
so let's get started with our typical HMO file.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:01:00,330
Title I see SS and in the body we're going to have a header of life in the wild and refresh.

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,610
Perfect.

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:10,400
And in here we're going to have a div with that class of container.

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,790
We'll close that off and in here let's add some images.

14
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,270
Now if you remember with images I can type in this.

15
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,870
And then tab with sublime text and we don't have any pictures yet.

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,000
So for now let's just copy and paste and add six images

17
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,180
save and refresh.

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,470
OK.

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:40,880
Let's start adding some of these images and actually have a file full of these images for you and I'll

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,310
attach it to the next lesson so you can also build it yourself.

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,130
So I'm just gonna copy these.

22
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,850
Quickly

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,560
who knows a lot of copy and pasting.

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,360
Let's save that and refresh.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,800
All right.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,590
We have our images and they're massive.

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,300
So let's make this a little bit smaller.

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:16,970
We can now go to our style sheet and we can select the images and let's just do width 450 pixels and

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:26,150
height 300 pixels and you might be asking yourself how come we don't do it here on the individual images.

30
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,570
Remember we can add attributes but that means if we needed to ever change anything we have to individually

31
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,190
go into each image and change it versus just changing in one location.

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,160
So for now we're going to stick to the CSX size.

33
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,460
Let's save that and refresh.

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:50,640
And obviously we need to link the file so let's add a link here and it will reference our style dot

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,630
CSX say that and refresh.

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,310
There you go.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
We have our images like that.

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,030
Some beautiful animals here now flex box has a great resource

39
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,370
obviously from CSX tricks and this is pretty much all you need.

40
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,980
It shows you all the things that flex box can do and as you can see it allows you to play around with

41
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,220
content and shift it around in a very nice way.

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,370
I'm going to attach this link for you the end of this video and you can take a look for yourself.

43
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,290
For now let's learn a few flex box properties.

44
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,140
We want to define that everything inside of this div is part of flex box.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,020
It's called container so let's do container.

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,020
And within this container we will say that display will be flex.

47
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,890
So that's how we activate flex box refresh.

48
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,140
OK.

49
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,380
We have a few changes which is nice but I don't want to scroll through this.

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,180
Ideally I can see everything without scrolling.

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,950
So if one thing we want to do and again we can look down over here at the suggestion we see that flex

52
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:20,790
wrap might be something that we want to add so let's do flex wrap and do wrap save and refresh.

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:29,620
OK that's perfect so if I make this bigger you see that everything is wrapping around OK but I think

54
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,840
the continents should be centered it kind of looks weird to having everything to the left over here.

55
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:42,000
So again we can do something called justify content and then we can do center and refresh.

56
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,700
Perfect.

57
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:49,940
And we if we look on the guide over here justify content should be right over here and can see all the

58
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,390
properties that it has that looks pretty good.

59
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,020
And we did that pretty fast made a nice little portfolio website already.

60
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,980
What else can we add now that we have this flexible container around our Web site.

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,260
Let's make the header a little bit prettier than it is now.

62
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:22,390
So that's the H1 we can had an H1 here and we'll say that the font family is like this one fancy save

63
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,970
and refresh.

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,170
Well I like that one font size let's make it a little bit bigger.

65
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,720
We'll do three E M so if you don't remember what E M is.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Make sure you check out the video.

67
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,240
OK.

68
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,070
So that looks better.

69
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,530
Maybe I'll be nice to have a bit of a border as well so we can do border bottom because we only want

70
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:54,100
a border on the bottom and we'll do two pixels solid pink and refresh OK.

71
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,310
Perfect.

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,060
That looks good.

73
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,070
But ideally I want a border just around this I don't want the entire section so we can actually just

74
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,820
say that for each one we want the width to be 400 pixels save and refresh.

75
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,420
All right.

76
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,440
Perfect.

77
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,820
That looks good.

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:19,650
And ideally this is centered so that the line underneath it is well on the left side and right side

79
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,050
is equally distributed so we can do something like text align center

80
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,460
and you'll notice here that it's aligned in the center but not the web page center.

81
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,480
It's a line in the center of the width of 400 pixels but that looks good would be actually nice to have

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,130
a border on here as well.

83
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:53,630
So let's add border right to pixels solid pink save and refresh.

84
00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:00,450
All right that looks very nice then the final thing I want to add is I want to have some spacing between

85
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:08,150
these images so I'm going to add a margin of 10 pixels here and refresh.

86
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,180
All right.

87
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,040
Let's take a look at our Web site right now

88
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,750
that looks very very nice.

89
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,530
As you can see flex box is a very easy thing to implement and it makes your Web sites look really really

90
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,400
nice and you can position your content very easily especially if you have these container like structures.

91
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,700
I want to show you one last resource for Flex box.

92
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,790
Again this is a tool that you'll see more and more of and ideally you'll build the Web sites using flex

93
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,650
box instead of some of the older ways.

94
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,900
One way to get really really good a flex box is to play this game.

95
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,200
And it's called flex box from me I believe.

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,350
Let's see and here you're trying to get the frog onto the leaf.

97
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:09,720
It's a little home so you can do something like justify content flex and look at that.

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,220
You get the frog onto the leaf and you move on to the next round.

99
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,080
I'll leave this for you.

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,420
It's a really really good way to learn flex box.

101
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,320
I think this is probably the best way to do layout and see.

102
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,640
I'll see you in the next one.

103
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,010
Bye bye.
