00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,610
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,750
In this section we're gonna be talking about some advanced topics in CSX and I'm going to start off

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,480
with the critical render path.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,090
What is that.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,860
Well we always should know how things work underneath the hood so we can make our websites as fast and

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,200
reliable as possible.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,670
So based on what we've built in the previous section let's look at what's happening underneath the hood.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,990
We are going to our Web site and ideally our Web site will be on a server and I'll show you how to do

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,530
that later on in the course.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,170
For now is just our computer.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,210
But let's pretend we have a server where our files are hosted.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,220
When we go to our Web site we'll call it cool Web site dot com.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:54,270
We request the HP email file and the browser now sees our HCM Alpha reads through this document and

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,050
as it's looking through it notices that oh I need a c assess file here so it goes back.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,100
Makes Another request and says Hey can you please give me a c file as well the server says yep no problem.

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,630
Let me grab that for you.

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:22,780
Grabs the C Ss file and now it starts looking at both the AC L and the C assess file to try and figure

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,310
out how the web page should look.

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,420
But then it also notices that hold on a second.

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,600
I need some fonts as well.

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,120
So it goes to this address and looks for a font.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,280
Again the Web site now asks the Web site that the fonts our host that act in our case is the Google

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,400
API and it grabs the font file.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,530
Now here's the thing.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,520
While it's grabbing the font file it could render the page and rendering means displaying so it could

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,550
display the Web site if it only has the ACM on CSX.

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,140
But it might not show up the text because the text is looking for the font file.

28
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:14,710
So when we talk about the critical render path we like to mention that CSX is their render blocking

29
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,200
file so you won't be able to render a web page until you receive your CSX.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,930
And sometimes if you have font files you'll also have to wait for the text to render on the page so

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,040
keep that in mind when you build your Web sites.

32
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,030
But what are things that we can consider when doing this so that our Web sites load up faster.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,720
One is maybe to have our own fun files.

34
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,920
Another one might be that you don't want to make your CSX too big.

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,680
If we had hundreds and hundreds of lines of code of CSX while the file gets bigger and bigger and it's

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,800
more and more that you have to transfer over the wire one method that people have used and you'll see

37
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,190
often is something called magnifying your CSX.

38
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:10,760
And if we open up a browser here you can do something called CSX magnify and CSX minute by what it does

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,470
is you can enter your CSX here you can see an example over here.

40
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:25,110
So you enter this and you click minute five and one minute five does it removes all the whitespace so

41
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,890
everything is on one line just really tiny together.

42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,360
So even though it's the same CSX it technically makes the file a little bit smaller so that the number

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,500
of bytes that you're sending over the Internet is a lot less and you'll see that technique used in JavaScript

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,090
as well.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,430
And we'll talk about that in that section but that is the critical render path a path that a Web site

46
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,060
takes to display something to the user.

47
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,780
I'll see in the next one by.
