00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,390
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,570
We're about to take the biggest step in our developer careers now.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,200
This is by far my favorite thing to teach.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,100
And I cannot wait to get started.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,850
But before I do I want you to know one thing: When I first started learning JavaScript it was the hardest

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,850
thing to get.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,650
I remember feeling confused and frustrated along the way and to be honest if this is your first time

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,460
learning a programming language you'll have those moments.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,850
I'm here to tell you to stick through it. Just like learning any language; with enough time in practice,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,720
you can become fluent.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,610
Now unlike human language though, you don't have to remember as many words, and sentence structure. So you

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,030
will get there I promise you this.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,420
Now don't just watch the videos in this section and fly through the content. Really work on the exercises

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,840
I give you at the end of the videos and make sure you understand each topic.

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,460
Finally, this section will teach you the basics of JavaScript.

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,970
It all seems very strange and detached sometimes from HTML on CSS - as a matter of fact we won't be touching

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,220
HTML and CSS very much.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,000
However, in the next section I will show you how our new found knowledge of JavaScript can now be connected

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,850
to our HTML and CSS websites.

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,180
This is when the real magic happens.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,110
So stay strong, stay determined.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,870
You'll get there in due time.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,240
Let's get started, shall we? See you in the next one. Bye-bye
