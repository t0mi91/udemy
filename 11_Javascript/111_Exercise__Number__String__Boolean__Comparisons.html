Get your sublime text ready for this exercise, and use Google Chrome javascript console to test your code. You can find the exercise file and the solution file attached. <strong>IMPORTANT: You need to open the&nbsp;exercise files in a coding editor like Sublime text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc, in order to see the code properly. If you open it in a text file you will see everything on one line and unformatted which is not what you want.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>You can also see the section outline you see in the video attached to this lecture!<br><br>Throughout this section,&nbsp;if you have any questions,&nbsp;reach out to our student community in the<strong>&nbsp;#js</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>#helpme</strong>&nbsp;channel on Discord (Lecture 2 provides the link if you have not yet joined)!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
