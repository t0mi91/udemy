00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,830
I wanted to show you something that we haven't really talked about.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:15,300
But again, it's important to know and that is that JavaScript has its own language to start off with.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,400
And these are called 'keywords' and you can see here

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:27,730
these are all JavaScript 'keywords' and what they mean is that when I changed this from 'Markdown' to 'JavaScript',

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,430
well, all of these, you can see have changed colors and that is because all these words are cues within JavaScript

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,400
that if you use them, it already has a predefined meaning attached to it.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,630
So, for example, if we open up the browser

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:01:00,360
and I do 'var for = 7', I'll get a 'SyntaxError' because, well 'for' is used for 'for loop'.

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,240
I can't do

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,760
'var' equals 'var'

12
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,690
'= 8' because, well, 'var' already means something in JavaScript.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,140
So, JavaScript 'keywords' are words that you cannot use, because it'll have unintended consequences.

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,840
JavaScript is going to read it and say 'Oh, you're trying to mean something that I already know the meaning

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,090
of'.

16
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,520
So, this list over here.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,090
You just have to be cautious that you don't name your variables or your functions this way.

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,300
But as you can see, these are the words that we've been using up until this point to create functions, to create

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,200
'for' loops and we'll encounter these throughout the course.

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,310
But I wanted to leave this for you in the next section, so that you'll have it as a reference.

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,920
I also want to show you what we've learned so far and I'm going to change this back to 'Markdown' so

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,510
it's a little bit cleaner.

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,440
Look at all the stuff we've done. We've done 'looping'.

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:07,290
We've learned about 'data structures', we've learned about 'functions', 'logical operators', 'conditionals', 'variables',

25
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:14,520
'comparisons' and 'types', and there's still a few things that are grayed out here, but we've learned 80%

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,580
of what's really-really important in JavaScript.

27
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,790
These other the ones that we'll get to in the advanced section, but what we've learned up until now is

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,490
something, that all computer programs have.

29
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,180
Once you learn this, if you wanted to learn a new language, there are small minor differences, but they

30
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,510
all have 'types'.

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,090
They all have 'conditionals'.

32
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,400
They all have 'loops'.

33
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,510
So once you master one programming language, you can move on to others a lot faster than your first one.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,070
So use that as motivation to go through all these things, that we've learned, because in the next few sessions

35
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,240
we're going to learn even more.

36
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,880
We've got a lot covered.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,730
I'm really proud of you making it this far.

38
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,990
Can't wait to see you on the next video.
