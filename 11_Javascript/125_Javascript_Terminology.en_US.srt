00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey there, welcome back! In this quick video I just want to go over the terminology that we've been using

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,750
again.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm just going to repeat it, so that you really have it nailed.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:20,490
The first one that we've learned about is the idea of 'function declaration' and 'function declaration' is a

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,310
way for us to create functions

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,840
like this.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:39,910
We also learned about 'function expression' and 'function expression' is a way for us to create functions

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,680
with a variable like

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,690
this.

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,160
And 'function expressions' can also have names.

11
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,220
Or it could be an anonymous function like this.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,040
You're more likely to encounter this than with names.

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,690
But I want to show you both of those.

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,370
OK.

15
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,530
What else do we have?

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,950
We also have this idea of 'expression' and an 'expression' is...

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,580
Well, this actually gives it a good-good overview and 'expression' is something that denotes a value.

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,030
So, '1+3;' is an 'expression' and we end 'expressions' with semicolon.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,280
If we do 'var a = 2;' that's an 'expression'.

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,960
If we're returning something from a function, we're returning 'true',

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,430
that's an expression. So an 'expression' is something that produces a value.

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,390
OK. How do we make a function perform that action?

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,370
Well, we call that 'calling' or 'invoking' a function.

24
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,270
And we do that by doing 'alert'.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:15,460
And then the brackets or we can do something like 'newFunction', 'param1', 'param2' and we call

26
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:31,900
or invoke a function this way. We also assign a variable and we do that by, well, we assign 'var a = true;' 

27
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,540
OK. We also learn about 'function vs. methods'.

28
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,960
Or method and a function is something like

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,670
'thisIsAFunction'

30
00:02:50,030 --> 00:03:04,860
A 'method' is something that is inside of an object, like 'thisIsAMethod'.

31
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,580
So the way we access them is different.

32
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:21,520
A 'function' is accessed like this, a 'method' is accessed with a 'dot' in front of it.

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,290
And there you have it: a few terminologies that I've been using that

34
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:35,720
hopefully, you've learned them by now, but wanted to recap everything, so that it really really sticks.

35
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,230
And this should make everything more clear.

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,860
I'll see you in the next one.

37
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,320
Bye-Bye
