00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,690
Welcome back. JavaScript was created in 1995 buy the Netscape web browser right over here. It was a way

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,490
for them to be able to add actions to websites. Think of JavaScript as the verb in anything you do on

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,670
a website. You tweet, you play a YouTube video, you sign up for a user name.

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,150
These are all actions we take on websites made possible through JavaScript.

5
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,870
In 1995 it was a way for this browser, Netscape, to beat the competition which were other browsers at

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,710
the time, because at the time Netscape was the most popular.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,690
Other browsers started adopting their own version of JavaScript, so that websites were work on their

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,490
browsers as well and thus less people switch over to their browsers.

9
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,360
Can you guess what happened next?

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,290
Well, every browser had their own idea of what JavaScript was.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,090
So there was no standard.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:08,370
Eventually a standard had to be created to make sure that everyone had the same idea what JavaScript was.

13
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:14,320
So that web developers can build one website and have it work on all browsers.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,290
This standard was called ECMAScript.

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:23,650
So yes, JavaScript and ECMAScript can be used interchangeably and you will hear both of these a lot.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,790
But it's the same language. Now

17
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,830
this browser compatibility issue - browsers having their own teams, their own schedule and their own code.

18
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,810
Sound familiar?

19
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,950
Yep! If you remember, it's the same thing that happened with HTML and CSS.

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,190
It's the same issue that we keep having

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,610
over and over.

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,620
We covered this topic in 'Web Developer Fundamentals Part 2'.

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,790
You see, it's always a big problem:

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,660
Make sure that all browsers have the same understanding of what (a) real

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,720
HTML, CSSA and JavaScript should be. So that when we send each one of those files, we don't have to

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,600
write one specific for each browser and just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is evolving.

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:21,770
So there are new things that we can do now, that you weren't able to do in 1995 with JavaScript. In the

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,900
'ES6' video section later on in the course we will talk about these new features, so don't worry.

29
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,430
Now let's take a look at what JavaScript does.

30
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,270
We can open up the browser and I have 'Udemy' over here.

31
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,300
Well 'Udemy' uses a lot of JavaScript.

32
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,930
I mean, clicking on a course, adding it to cart, liking the post.

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,570
All these things.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,940
Well, they're all JavaScript. Even if you open categories over here, you see this dropdown and I can select

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,400
things and there's actions, constantly happening throughout the website.

36
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:07,990
That's all JavaScript. But it's not just the Web, that use JavaScript on. Instagram?

37
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,840
Well Instagram uses JavaScript.

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,250
What about something else?

39
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,280
Maybe, virtual reality?

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,630
Yeah.

41
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,620
You can do that too.

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,590
You can do 'VR', 'VR games',

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,030
'VR apps' with JavaScript. That's, that's pretty cool.

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,520
What else can JavaScript do?

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,730
Well, you can actually program drones with JavaScript and control them from your Wii remote if you wanted

46
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,160
to.

47
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,260
What about robotics?

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,170
Yeah, this guy built a robot.

49
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,120
That he can control from his web browser.

50
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,980
How cool is that.

51
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,600
Now remember Node.js?

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,850
We talked about this slide at the beginning of the course and how we're going to learn these topics.

53
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,600
Well, some of this is able to be done because of it.

54
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,820
But Node.js is pretty much JavaScript, it is JavaScript.

55
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,710
So you learn JavaScript.

56
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:15,380
You can pick up backend stuff very easily and the 'Node.js' section of this course will be a breeze.

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,720
It's not a new language

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
that you'll learn.

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,600
So is Express.

60
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,480
So is React.

61
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,200
So this is why JavaScript is so important.

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,410
What we will learn here will take you very far in the rest of your career.

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,270
This is one skill that really opens up a lot of possibilities.

64
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,250
Here's the beauty of JavaScript though and any other programming languages, because what is JavaScript

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:46,800
really? It's, it's a file, a father who can write instructions to a computer.

66
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,580
In the example of a robot arm all you had to do is write.

67
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,610
If I press this button - move arm to the right, if I press this button -

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,100
move arm to the left.

69
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,150
It all looks extremely complicated, but as you will see, no matter how complex the program, let's say an

70
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,830
online game like 'World of Warcraft',

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,840
well, everything is built one block at a time.

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,720
One simple logic at a time. In the next section we're going to start writing our first JavaScript in

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,860
our first simple pieces of logic.

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,820
Don't let it fool you though. Although it may look simple.

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,730
These are the building blocks that allow you to build big web apps like Facebook or Google. Exciting

76
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,910
things are going to happen with your newfound power.

77
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,310
So I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
