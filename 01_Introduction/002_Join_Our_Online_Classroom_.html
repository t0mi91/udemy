In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment this year, we are introducing a Discord online classroom&nbsp;where you can:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Introduce yourself&nbsp;<br>- Ask the community questions&nbsp; <br>- Get help with exercises&nbsp;<br>- Meet other students around the world&nbsp; <br>- Learn how to&nbsp;answer questions&nbsp;<br>- Learn from each other</strong></p><p>Many students have said this is the best part of the course as you will feel like you are learning in a classroom rather than by yourself in front of&nbsp;a computer. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. <strong>The Discord&nbsp;community should give you faster replies to your questions from the community, while learning another valuable tool of a programmer. </strong><br></p><p><strong>Once there,&nbsp;you can sign up and click on channels to explore different topics.&nbsp; </strong><br><br>I'll see you inside!<br><br><br>(Thanks to Pavel, a fellow student, for contributing the below icon)</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/kDsZfGc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Join by clicking here: https://discord.gg/nVmbHYY</strong></a><br><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-a.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2018-04-30_11-16-17-6fd45185cec533f952726fc84729768b.png?mvdcmANH5dbcKN6jDVTvx9DskJBkxqNgf7op2f2tHXu7TdWPuftgC0rocl7Jyv6M9OkZG1ZSAKunZM6hcGWSVNe0njirGUwptOaS2MOOZ70kKdHslTuufeLgFQ-5wEQK-1VxTaKp8Yk_9hp2FSAfZf17zHIGVgEutK5mwfmUSUWtuBpy"></figure><p><br></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
