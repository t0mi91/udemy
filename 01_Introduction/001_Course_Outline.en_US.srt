1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's talk about how this course will look like
for you.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,310
Each section has some sort of actionable steps
that you are able to follow such as building websites

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,479
and sample projects and everything we use in this course
is a tool that companies use in real life.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,640
They're the best of the best.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,070
So let's look at the course outline.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,189
The first part will be an introduction.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,760
Some basic concepts to get us familiar with the web
and how it works.

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,910
We will start off with how the internet works
what is the history of these technologies.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,139
We're going to talk about the history of the web,
the web browsers and I'll actually have you understand

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,980
the underlying concepts of the Internet and how the technologies
we have now have come to be where they are.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,789
And then we're going to learn HTML5.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,509
Finally building our first website we'll also get into some
advanced HTML where we're going to build

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,160
some complex forms and get you really really good at this technology.

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,850
We will then move into CSS which allows us to style our websites and make them beautiful.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:16,969
Afterwards we'll get into advanced CSS
and using CSS3 features like transitions and gradients in

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,570
the advanced CSS section we'll create
a background generator project that is going to be a lot of fun.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,379
Once we've mastered how to work with websites
using HTML and CSS will then start learning about

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:37,249
Bootstrap, templates and building your own startup landing page that accepts e-mails and will actually

19
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,229
store the e-mails of users as people
who are interested in your startup.

20
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,520
A very useful skill that
you will definitely need in your career.

21
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,349
Or if you have a business idea
that you want to pursue.

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:57,109
We will also dive into newer features of CSS
like flexbox my favorite CSS grid and get really really

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,039
good at doing responsive layouts with CSS.

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,230
Finally we finish off part one
with career of a developer.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,390
What does a career of a developer
actually entail.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,770
What are the salaries.

27
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:16,999
What are the differences between a software developer,
mobile developer, software engineer, full stack

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,469
developer.

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,179
We're going to cover all that
and we're also going to talk about the future trends and what skills do

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,269
you need in the future. From part one
we move to our next section in here we'll start to introduce

31
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:36,139
JavaScript and learn concepts that allow us to learn
a real programming language and the most popular

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,880
programming language which is JavaScript.

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,770
We then move to DOM manipulation
where we'll actually use JavaScript to create actions and behaviors

34
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,610
to our websites.

35
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,770
So they're interactive.

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,750
And then finally we're going to learn some
advanced JavaScript concepts so that we can use JavaScript

37
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,140
to control the machines around us.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,979
Now just knowing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
is not good enough and you won't be able to grow in your

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,400
role and command a higher salary just with those three skills.

40
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,789
I'm going to be teaching you these things coming up
because these are the things you should know so

41
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,680
that you are miles ahead of the rest.

42
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,439
So after the JavaScript section we're going to start
getting into the command line and working with

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,160
the terminal.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,290
We then learn about developer environments
and I'll actually show you what my developer environment

45
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,930
on my computer looks like when I'm working.

46
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,989
We'll be setting up our own computers
with all the tools necessary of a real life developer so you can

47
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,979
use the same setup when you go and work
for somebody or for yourself.

48
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,469
We will then learn about Git and GitHub.

49
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,710
Probably the most important tools of a developer
and I'll show you how teams work with these technologies

50
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,949
to create collaborative software.

51
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,540
We then get into a fun section
which is a day in the life of a developer.

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,890
I'll show you what a day today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
what it looks like and what tools you'll use.

53
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,399
I will take you through a sample day at a tech company
just so that's on your first day of the job.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,730
You won't be surprised.

55
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,049
We will then jump to NPM and NPM scripts
a way for developers to share their code and it's going to

56
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,200
open up a whole world of possibilities in this section.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,959
We're also going to create
our own customizable portfolio project.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,620
So moving forward you can add the projects from this course
to your website and have it as your online

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,140
resume.

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,690
Finally we finish off part two with React.js

61
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,600
You'll learn the library that companies like
Netflix, Facebook and Instagram used to build fast

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,899
scalable applications.

63
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,260
This is one of the highest
in demand skills in the industry.

64
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,570
It's so much fun.

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,810
And I'm really really excited about
that section from part two.

66
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:00,950
We'll move on to the world outside of just the front-end
and we're going to learn about HTTP JSON AJAX

67
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,100
something that will open up
a world of possibilities.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,570
We'll learn about the back-end basics
and what back-end developers do.

69
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,420
And then finally I'll introduce you to some APIs
what APIs are and definitely some really interesting

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,039
APIs that are out there.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,919
This section is really going to open up your world
from just being a front-end developer that is really

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,989
good at building websites to somebody
that can create really dynamic applications.

73
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,449
And it will set us up for Part 4.

74
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,800
This is where it gets really really fun.

75
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,759
We're gonna start working on our final project called
smart brain and we're gonna start off by working

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,879
on the front-end that is using
CSS, JavaScript, HTML and react.

77
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,290
We're going to build an image recognition app
that's gonna be really really fun.

78
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:56,979
You submit a URL and using a machine learning API
we're gonna detect to see if in that photo there

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,620
is a face and then detect where that faces with a square box.

80
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,519
We're gonna create a sign-in form a registration form
and it's gonna be really really impressive something

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,579
that you're gonna be able to use in your portfolio
and impress future employers or clients.

82
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,020
We then take a break from the smart brain project to introduce you to Node.js and Express.

83
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,129
This is where I show you how to build a server
how to create a RESTful API so that when we get into

84
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,129
the next section the smart brain server section
we build our own server so that we're actually able

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:39,649
to communicate with the server over HTTP
and sign in to our app sign out have profiles and do all sorts

86
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,920
of really interesting things. From there

87
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,599
we again take a break and learn about databases
a really complex topic but I'm going to make it simple

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,270
for you to understand how they work and in the next section
we're actually going to create our own database

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:01,189
using Postgres and connected to our server
so that at the end you'll have a fully working app that

90
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:09,379
has a front-end client website, a back-end server
and a server that's working with a database. Pretty

91
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,839
much a full fledged application.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,239
And finally we're going to deploy and launch
that application so you know exactly how to put a real

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,479
life app that is secure and won't get hacked on the web
and don't worry I'm going to provide all files

94
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,269
for you throughout the sections so that you can just
add them to your portfolio or you can work along

95
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,780
the videos as well depending on
what your learning style is.

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,690
You can follow along whichever way
works best for you.

97
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,139
And at the end of the course I'm also going to have
a quick little section of some of my favorite resources

98
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,950
to get hired.

99
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,879
Some of my own advice on finding a job of your dreams.
By the end of this course you're going to learn

100
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,350
the skills that allow you to apply
for jobs in the following roles:

101
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,570
web developer, software developer, front-end developer,
javascript developer or a full-stack developer

102
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,840
You're going to learn the technologies that are
actually being used behind tech companies.

103
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,559
You're going to be able to build
your own websites and applications.

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,509
But most importantly you're going to master
fundamental concepts in web development so that it sets

105
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,329
you up for a bright long career.

106
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,879
I also want to make this course interactive.
I'll be making videos of student projects and what others

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,380
have built in this course like you.

108
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,099
I'll also have Q&amp;A videos where based on the most popular questions
or the most popular topics I'm

109
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:35,350
going to create new videos as they are suggested.
We have a lot to cover but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

110
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,530
Let's get started.
