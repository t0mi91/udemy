00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:11,070
Welcome back. So far we've taken a look at how Javascript interacts with HTML and CSS and we've

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,390
seen that we've been able to change text, change styles and interact with our Web page.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,350
In this video we're going to try something fun.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,780
We're going to have an exercise where we're going to create a background generator so that for our future

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,660
projects we can have a nice awesome gradient for our backgrounds.

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,670
We're going to use just a few lines of Javascript to create this.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,830
So let's get started.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,460
All right we have a beautiful blank canvas here.

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,080
Open up the console so that as we write code make sure we don't make any errors and we're going to start

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,420
off with a simple HTML file.

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:05,780
We'll call it gradient background and within the body we'll have a few things we'll have in each one

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:18,560
that will say background generator and we'll also have an H2 that will say current CSS background

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,790
and we'll have an H3 that will be blank for now because we're going to be putting the CSS style so

14
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,250
that people can copy and paste that background gradient from right in here.

15
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:42,630
And obviously we need Javascript so we'll add a script tag and we'll do source equals the script dot JS.

16
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes let's refresh Now I want to show you two cool things that comes with HTML and CSS.

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,780
The first is the input type color.

18
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,630
And the second is CSS's linear gradient.

19
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,330
So CSS3 has these cool gradient backgrounds that we can do.

20
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:21,640
So we'll use this syntax to create our gradient and for the color picker we'll use the HTML type

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,850
color for the input to get a color picker so we can do that fairly quick.

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:40,500
Let's go right below the H2 and we'll create an input and the type will be color name will be color

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,180
1 and we can actually also give it a default value so we'll do value and we'll just put it in a random

24
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,030
HEX color will do

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,720
00ff00. And we want to have two color pickers because the way gradients work it

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,490
goes from one color to the other.

27
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,070
So we'll put another color picker will save.

28
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:16,510
Change the name to color2 this time this color will have more red and refresh and there you go.

29
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,400
We have our color pickers.

30
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,840
Now the one thing I want to show you.

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,940
I created a style sheet that I'll provide for you that will have some default style so it looks really

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,950
really good.

33
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:38,080
And we can include that in our HTML file will say Link style

34
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,610
CSS and if I refresh.

35
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:51,390
Well we got an awesome background with our cool font and everything centered just show you quickly what

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,330
made the background have this gradient.

37
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:03,390
All I did was have the background linear gradient and you go to and then give it a direction we want

38
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,510
to go to the right and we give it the starting color and the ending color.

39
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,620
So that's the default color that we have.

40
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,750
The rest is all just font and text aligning.

41
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,290
So nothing too crazy nothing that you can't do yourself but the one thing that we need is this needs to

42
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,410
be interactive.

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,080
If I pick a color here well I want to change same for this one.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,940
And ideally if I find a background that are really really light for my app I can print it out over here

45
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,000
so I can just copy and paste the linear gradient and use that.

46
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,840
So let's work on that.

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,640
What do we know so far?

48
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,630
We know that Javascript can read from the DOM and it can affect it.

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,890
So we want to read what the value what the colors are of both inputs.

50
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,840
And we want to put out a piece of text at the bottom here with those values in the CSS format.

51
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:21,620
So it looks like we'll need to select two inputs and then also select the H3 so we can enter some text

52
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:32,610
here. Let's go to the script JS file and the first thing we want to do is we want to select the H3.

53
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:43,670
So all of our CSS equals document dot querySelector and because there's only one H3 we can

54
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,510
just select H3. OK.

55
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:56,490
We also want to select the colors and we should give it a class to so we can distinguish them.

56
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:12,270
So I'm going to say a class equals color1 and the other one will have class color2.

57
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,040
So now we can do variable color1

58
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:24,790
equals document querySelector and we'll do color1.

59
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,880
Again it's a querySelector. So we do classSelector just like we do in CSS and for color2 we do the

60
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,820
same thing.

61
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,040
This looks good for now.

62
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,890
We ideally grab all these

63
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,650
and our background should change.

64
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,210
Let's check everything and make sure that we are correct.

65
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
And what have you done so far.

66
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,810
Let's refresh the page and there you go.

67
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:12,420
We have our H3 that's where we're going to want to have our CSS text for our background.

68
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,920
We have our inputs.

69
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,150
The first one and the second one.

70
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,750
OK it looks like we're doing everything right.

71
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,220
Now what do we want to happen?

72
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,090
We want to listen to an event where we notice the user's actions here.

73
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:38,370
We've learned about click and mouse center and key press.

74
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,810
But this isn't really any of those is it?

75
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:49,610
Well there is a really really good event for inputs and it's called input.

76
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,700
So any time the input value changes which it does every time we change the color we can detect it.

77
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,810
So let's think about how we would do this.

78
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,580
We want to have color1 to have an event listener.

79
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:20,020
That will have input and you will have a function that for now we can just console dot log

80
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,980
color1 dot value.

81
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,290
Now we also want the second color to have the same thing.

82
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,530
But for color2. Let's refresh and check here we remove the console logs because we don't need any

83
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,460
more refresh and let's see. Look at that.

84
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,320
You see them in the console.

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,940
This is getting updated.

86
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,290
That's pretty cool.

87
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,730
All right so the first one's working.

88
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,260
The second one now it's working too. Awesome.

89
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,480
So we're grabbing the colors, the color of value.

90
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,680
What do we want to do next with this value.

91
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,780
Well we want to change the background color.

92
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,400
And how can we do that? Well the background if we right click and do inspect.

93
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,340
You make this bigger this bigger.

94
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:25,230
We see that the background is in the body tag so ideally we change this.

95
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,830
Let's go back to the console.

96
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,170
Minimize this and let's try and change the background now with the information that we have.

97
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,700
Any time color1 changes we want to grab the background's tag.

98
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:46,560
Well again we can say body equals document dot get...

99
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,390
getElementBy and let's have an Id here.

100
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,820
Well say Id

101
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:07,150
gradient and we can say get elementById and we'll say gradient.

102
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,310
Again we want to make sure that we're actually selecting it.

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,180
So let's try

104
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,430
body and refresh.

105
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:25,750
All right we're getting the body tag and if we remember we can change the style of the body by doing

106
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,350
style dot background. That's

107
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,620
a CSS property and we can just say red. see if that works.

108
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,030
Great.

109
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,000
We're changing the color to red but that doesn't look as good as great but at least now we know how

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,340
to change this so we can say when the first input changes, body dot background or style dot background

111
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,270
equals linear gradient to right.

112
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,740
And there's just the syntax you'll have to get used to.

113
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,520
And we'll say the first color will be color1 dot value and we'll need a comma for that.

114
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:23,080
And the second value will be inside a space here color2 value.

115
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:32,650
So that's the second color picker and we'll say plus close the bracket and the CSS and it should be good

116
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,360
to go.

117
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,550
And I put this on a new line just so you can see it.

118
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,080
Perfect and again javascript doesn't see the semicolons here so it just keeps reading line by line.

119
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,850
OK so let's save and see if we did that right.

120
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,730
I'm going to refresh and actually you don't need a semicolon here.

121
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,510
So let's see if that works.

122
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:05,160
I'm going to refresh select the first one and look at that and get ourself the gradient working.

123
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,760
But obviously we need to do the second one as well because right now is just console logging.

124
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:23,620
Again let's do the same thing into the second color picker I save and refresh you picked the first one

125
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,390
and we pick the next one.

126
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,560
Look at that.

127
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,510
That's really pretty.

128
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,710
But that should have triggered something.

129
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,090
We just copy and pasted the same lines of code.

130
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,790
And if we remember that's a big problem because dry. Do not repeat yourself.

131
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,750
So how can we extract this function so that it's a lot cleaner?

132
00:12:49,940 --> 00:13:01,800
Very easy we can create a function and we'll say set the gradient and set gradient well, as the name

133
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,780
suggests set our beautiful gradient.

134
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:17,590
So now this function can just be called setGradient and same for the second color.

135
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,550
I can say setGradient look how much cleaner that looks.

136
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,850
Well let's see if everything still works.

137
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,590
I'm going to refresh.

138
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,210
I'm going to select.

139
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,190
And looks like we broke something.

140
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,810
See what we did here.

141
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,570
This event of input gets triggered automatically and runs a function.

142
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:51,210
We don't need to call the function because this input event is triggered automatically and the second

143
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,680
parameter automatically gets ran with the event.

144
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:06,610
So now if I save this select one everything works again just to reiterate. If we had called the functions

145
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,360
like these.

146
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:15,400
The first pass through when the HTML documents loaded it reads the script file and it goes through the

147
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,230
lines.

148
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,480
And when we have the event listener we also set the gradient.

149
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,930
But we want this to be called every time the input is selected.

150
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,840
So again our function is now like this and we have ourself

151
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,950
beautiful background generator.

152
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,800
We're actually going to use this when we design our final project because well I think the backgrounds

153
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,270
look pretty cool with this.

154
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,760
Very cool.

155
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,250
And you see how easier that was fairly fast

156
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,060
Just a few lines of code.

157
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:07,180
I want to show you one last thing and that is we've been using addEventListener which is the recommended

158
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,440
way of doing things because we're keeping the Javascript and the Javascript file but we could have also

159
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:24,560
done within the input an onclick attribute or oninput attribute.

160
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:35,250
So within here I could have said, because we have this available to us setGradient I could have said

161
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:47,390
setGradient and also on the second one we would do setGradient

162
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,730
so we'll see if this works.

163
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,520
If I comment these out so I never had the event listener and I refresh

164
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,510
see that it still changes.

165
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,850
What is the difference between doing this and doing it this way?

166
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:21,320
Well the difference is that here we're adding Javascript to HTML against separation of concerns.

167
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:28,550
And also you can see here that we can only add setGradient.

168
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:40,150
So this input can only have one oninput attribute versus here where we can keep adding different functions

169
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,250
different events.

170
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,010
So this is a lot more extensible but I wanted to show you that you can do that and you can do an

171
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,350
onclick function is just an HTML specifications.

172
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:59,360
When we get to the React section you'll see that it has its own way of doing these type of events.

173
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:08,030
So again I'm going to restore that refresh back to our beautiful Website.

174
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:14,550
There is one other thing that we need to do and that is we need to have the CSS at the bottom right here.

175
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,460
That's very easy to do.

176
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:24,630
We can just say CSS dot textContent which is new.

177
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:33,110
You haven't seen it before. But you can just say body dot style dot background and we'll add the

178
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,070
semicolons.

179
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,570
If I save and refresh

180
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,410
look at that. As we pick the gradient

181
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:54,060
we have this updating.

182
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,350
Now a few questions you may have one.

183
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,450
What is this textContent thing?

184
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,310
Up until now I've shown you innerHTML.

185
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:18,070
I also showed you createTextNode and now we have textContent like there's so many things to remember.

186
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,960
What is it?

187
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:28,870
It adds a text content as you can see there's many many ways to add things to the DOM.

188
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,950
And the reason I did this is because I wanted to show you the frustration that a lot of people had an

189
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,330
early 2000s when working with the DOM.

190
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:47,080
And in the next video I'm going to talk about some of those issues and what we did to resolve that. And

191
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,210
eventually when we would get into React we'll see that we actually won't be using any of these because

192
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,580
React has extracted all of these out for us so that it's a lot simpler than figuring out how to enter

193
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:09,780
text content adding event listeners and all this stuff that can get frankly pretty frustrating at times.

194
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,830
That's it for now.

195
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,690
Let's see what else you can add onto this background.

196
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:21,400
I'll leave the code for you in the next section so you can play around with it and make it even better

197
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,230
than it is right now.

198
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll see you in the next one.

199
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,090
Bye bye.
