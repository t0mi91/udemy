1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,450
It's time to get back to building web pages.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,050
But this time with JavaScript.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,030
Up until now we've learned HTML and CSS and then we learned JavaScript

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,380
but separately. The true power though comes when we combine all these three technologies. Now the previous

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,370
videos I mentioned how JavaScript allowed actions to be performed on the webpage. Well what did they

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,030
mean there?

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,090
By adding JavaScript to our web pages we now have the power that we never had with HTML

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,790
and CSS. We can change all the HTML elements in the page,

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,120
we can change all the HTML attributes in the page, change all the CSS styles on the page,

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,400
remove existing HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elments and attributes and JavaScript

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,570
can also react to existing HTML events or it can create its own HTML events on the page.

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,370
Now some of these things like changing CSS tiles or HTML attributes and elements.

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:24,710
Well we could kind of do them before but with JavaScript we can do this while the user is on the page.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,410
Let's look at the diagram.

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,300
We requested the HTML and then the web browser saw the link tag.

17
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:46,320
Grab the CSS and before we use JavaScript if we wanted to change the style or change how the HTML looked.

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,100
Maybe we want to click on the 'About' page.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:02:01,530
While we would request the HTML and the CSS us all over again to change how the web page looked but now

20
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,650
with JavaScript all you need is this and JavaScript can do that all for you if you want it to all on

21
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,070
the same page.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,260
Now in this section we're going to learn all of that. In order to do that

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,090
though we must go back to our diagrams and understand two things.

24
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,780
One is the DOM and the second is the JavaScript engine.

25
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:34,140
Up to this point we spoke how HTML gets requested then CSS, then the browser does something special, it

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,340
creates something called the DOM.

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,160
That kind of looks like this.

28
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,860
When a web page is loaded the browser creates the DOM which stands for Document Object Model.

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,880
You see over here that we have document with the root element HTML.

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,460
We have a head element, body element with some 'a' tags and 'h1' tags.

31
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,000
What does this really mean?

32
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,520
You can actually see the same thing in the console, so let's check that out.

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,990
So the DOM or the Document Object Model is simply 'document'.

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,490
So over here if we open up the document there you go.

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,440
We have the same thing that we saw in the elements tab. Let me close the style over here.

36
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,890
Right in the console.

37
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,580
Now why do we need the DOM?

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:37,050
Well we needed a way to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements, so the DOM was created so we can do something

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,070
like this.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,530
'document.write("helloooo")'

41
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:51,590
and watch what happens to the web page, it changes to

42
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,590
"helloooo".

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,700
So the DOM is something a browser creates to allow us to modify the HTML and CSS.

44
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,420
OK now what about the other phrase that I mentioned,

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,770
the JavaScript engine? Well up to this point

46
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:14,540
we talked about how each browser loads up JavaScript and it magically reads it.

47
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,490
What does that even mean?

48
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:24,110
Well each browser has a thing called 'JavaScript engine' and they all have pretty cool names.

49
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:35,710
Chrome has 'V8 engine', Edge has 'Chalker Core', Safari has 'Nitro' and Firefox has 'SpiderMonkey'. And what

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,670
they do is they are the ones that look at the JavaScript file and read it line by line and execute the

51
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,830
JavaScript.

52
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,300
So how do these two tie together?

53
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,400
Well now we can use JavaScript to talk with the DOM.

54
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,960
You see when we did document dot write (document.write)

55
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,110
that was JavaScript wasn't it?

56
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:09,390
That looks like an object and it had the write method that accepted an argument

57
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:18,250
'helloooo'. Web browsers allow us to access the DOM through the document object and that's what it is it's

58
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,330
an object.

59
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:26,710
And now we have the power that we mentioned before to do all the things to essentially modify how our

60
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,410
web page looks.

61
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:38,530
So knowing what we do, document is the screen that we see in the browser. Right over here and the document

62
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,210
as I mentioned is just an object.

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,520
Now does it have a parent object? Well as a matter of fact

64
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,940
it does.

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,850
It's called a window.

66
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:59,610
And you see over here a window is an object with a whole ton of properties.

67
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:08,130
But if we scroll to here we see that one of the properties is document and it even highlights it for

68
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,790
us and if we open up the document it has more properties.

69
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:24,730
Also, remember 'alert' and 'prompt' look at that the window object has alert.

70
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,570
So let's try something.

71
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:34,960
If I did 'window.alert("check check")' will this still work?

72
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,920
Let's see? Yep it still works.

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:49,790
The reason that 'alert' worked like this was because 'window' is - you can think of it as the big parent of

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:59,680
everything and a browser window is an object that describes this browser and anytime you use a method

75
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:08,210
like 'alert' if you don't specify anything it assumes that you're talking about the window object,

76
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:16,410
the biggest parent. But remember 'document.write'?

77
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:25,340
Can we do that on the window object?

78
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,100
Let's check this. I get an error 'window.write'

79
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,410
is not a function because it doesn't exist as a property of 'window'

80
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:43,310
tt exists as a property of document which is a property of 'window'.

81
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:54,580
So let's recap. A web browser has a window object that has a property 'document' that specifies what should

82
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,390
get displayed to decide what to get displayed

83
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:10,030
the document object, the document object model reads the HTML and CSS and then JavaScript that is read

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,590
line by line by something like a JavaScript engine -

85
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,380
In Google Chrome that's the V-8 engine - reads through it.

86
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:27,400
And if it ever needs to change anything JavaScript can speak with the document object and modify the

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,850
HTML and CSS. Using our new found power, in the next video

88
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,510
we're going to start manipulating the DOM to make our websites more interactive with JavaScript.

89
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,100
Let's get started. Bye-bye
