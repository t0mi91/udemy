1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,440
When I teach students for the first time DOM manipulation and events it's always overwhelming.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,230
It takes a few tries to really get it.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,620
And one thing you may have noticed in the previous videos is that there were a lot of methods that you

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:23,990
learned and the Dom has a lot of them but you constantly have to check and see if it was compatible

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,450
with the browsers to make sure it works.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,860
So we used websites like can I use dot com to constantly check that we can use those properties.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,000
It was a tedious process a few years ago.

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,320
The support for the selectors and DOM manipulation techniques were even worse.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,540
For example query selector now is all good but a few years ago only a few browsers have them.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,510
So what did people do if it was even worse than it is now.

11
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,280
Well there was a library that was created that solved this huge problem.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
And that was jQuery.

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,230
You might have heard of it.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:16,200
It's one of the most popular libraries for JavaScript. In 2006 J.A.G. was introduced to the Web development

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,010
world.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,970
It was a library which means it's just JavaScript a JavaScript file run by a few people that added a

17
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,660
little bit more to the language so you can do more things.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,140
You had more properties more functions.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,730
Its main goal was to make DOM manipulation easier and compatible with all browsers.

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,820
So they took care of the hard work and browser compatibility issues.

21
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,860
Isn't that nice of them?

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,940
Let's check this W3C example of jQuery.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:59,860
You can see over here that they're loading a script tag with a CDN that is pointed at a jQuery minified

24
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,860
JavaScript and jQuery is just this snippet of code.

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:16,180
It always has the dollar sign document dot ready which means, when the document the DOM object is ready

26
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,080
run this function and inside of it you are write all this

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,940
jQuery.

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,420
So in this case you can see that we want to select P.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,800
This was a jQuery specific syntax and on click run this function.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,940
So it was the exact same thing as when we did p

31
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:44,340
Dot addEventListener and then we would do click and then do some sort of a function.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,610
So you can see it made things a little bit cleaner to do and you can do things like this dot hide.

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,630
So if I click over here it hides.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,150
It hides it hides.

35
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,360
That's pretty nice.

36
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,960
But jQuery had a one issue.

37
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,690
It made the code very imperative.

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,600
And what does that mean?

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,670
It's a word you're going to hear a lot when you become a developer.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,560
It means that you have to tell the program exactly what to do.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,160
One by one this may not seem like a bad idea but when your websites get big and complicated it creates

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,550
a huge mess.

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,140
One action is dependent on one action which is dependent on another action which is dependent on another

44
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,830
action.

45
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,730
Now you lose track of what is happening.

46
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,420
More errors and more bugs into your codebase and it becomes really really complicated.

47
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,490
Let me show you an example.

48
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,320
We have a simple jQuery code here where we say again document ready function and then we're selecting

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,990
article left section when the click happens.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,770
Then we check this has a class and we remove class and I mean this doesn't look that bad.

51
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:12,100
But it got to a point where you had code like this called pyramid of Doom where if this happens you

52
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,680
do this and if this happens you do this and if this happens you do this and you can imagine if there

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,130
was another thing that was listening to another event that might have unexpected consequences because

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,760
this is running and the user is at the same time interacting with the website.

55
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,910
And you can see here how much of a mess it is I mean this is this is just an example but you can see

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,850
that it's very imperative.

57
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,940
This happens and do this and within it if that happens then do this and so on and so forth.

58
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,520
It creates a big mess when you have big websites.

59
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,810
jQuery was great at the time he made JavaScript really popular because it was finally easy to make interactive

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,140
websites and it did a lot of great things for the industry.

61
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,380
However as time progressed people found new and better ways to do things.

62
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,450
Web browsers adapted new things like querySelector.

63
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:19,330
And we even have a website now that compares what you can do with simple JavaScript and HTML and what

64
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,860
you can do with jQuery and most of the things you can do both.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,850
And it's not that different as time progressed people found new and better ways to do things.

66
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,070
You still have jQuery being used today but there are fewer and fewer people starting projects that

67
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,010
are using jQuery right now.

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,300
As a matter of fact the number of job postings with jQuery as a requirement has really gone down

69
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:50,130
and there's rather a negative view of developers who only know jQuery this is not to bash a library.

70
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,380
It was an important part of JavaScript growth.

71
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,340
But in 2018 it isn't that useful of a skill.

72
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:04,150
That is why in this course we are learning React. React is a library that solves the huge problem of

73
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,960
jQuery.

74
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,650
Instead of being imperative it's declarative. We will get into more of the benefits and what that means

75
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,520
when we get to the section.

76
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,000
But having a historical perspective of where we were and where we are now is important.

77
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,130
So remember this.

78
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,760
First we had HTML, then CSS and JavaScript.

79
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,360
Then came jQuery to make our JavaScript easier.

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,540
Then came more libraries that made JavaScript even more fun and easy to work with.

81
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,320
From now on we won't be using DOM manipulation techniques we have learned in this section.

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,250
Bummer. I know but I'll show you what we can do better.

83
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,620
So stay tuned.

84
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,760
It gets way more fun after this.

85
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,280
I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye.
