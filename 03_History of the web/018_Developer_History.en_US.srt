00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,910
And welcome back to the final lesson
from 'The History of the Web'.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,759
I wanted to finish things off with this diagram that
we've seen before in previous lessons, with a few

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,850
minor differences.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,200
And that is, I wanted to show you how web
applications were built in the early 2000s.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,770
So they were built with technologies that
we've come to familiarize ourselves with.

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:31,510
We have HTML, CSS, Javascript, but we also had
JQuery, and JQuery was a library that allowed

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:41,609
Javascript to be written in a simple, clean way that
allowed us not to worry too much about working in

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,030
one browser, then the other.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,299
It created this environment for Javascript to
flourish but it is an outdated technology and there's

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,559
better ways of doing things.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,820
So it is not used very often and you'll
see it less and less in job postings.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:09,279
And then on the back-end we have the LAMP stack
that stands for Linux Apache MySQL, and PHP.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,690
And in those days, back-end developers used PHP to write
files that allowed us to have logic on the servers.

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,000
And then we had Apache.

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:29,179
So if you ever use something like HostGator and
you had to log in to cPanel, or any of those very

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,400
common hosting platforms,
most likely they're running Apache server.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:42,189
And what it is - it's a software that really efficiently
serves up files, and PHP is a language that is

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,170
still being used today and
Facebook actually uses it.

19
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,520
But that's because their website
was built in the early 2000s.

20
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:57,060
It is now a very unpopular, let's say, language
in terms of growth and job opportunities.

21
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,310
And then we also had MySQL,
which it's still being used.

22
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,370
But again if you're looking to get hired and you
want to look for skills that are highly employable

23
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:13,260
people are looking for them and there are still
very few developers that know it really well.

24
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,150
Well that's what we're learning in this course,
and this course we're going to learn HTML5, CSS3,

25
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,390
we're going to learn Javascript.

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,049
We're going to learn React, probably
biggest library for Javascript and we're

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,949
going to learn about Node servers, Node.JS, Express.JS,
we're going to learn about PostgreSQL, and

28
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,999
also MongoDB.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,260
So we're learning all these things in order for us
to build clean, fast, and bug free web applications

30
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,629
so that we can stand on shoulders of giants, so we
can create wonderful applications that we're proud

31
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,300
of. So get excited.

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,810
All the theory stuff, we're done with.
We're going to start coding.

33
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,239
We're going to start off with HTML, then get into
CSS, and then finally Javascript, and React. And

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,540
don't worry,
we'll get to the back-end as well.

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,960
So I'll see in the next section. Bye-bye.
