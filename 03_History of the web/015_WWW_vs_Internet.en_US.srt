00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,979
Hello and welcome back to another video - we actually
have a couple of great videos coming up about the

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,440
history of the web and
you might be asking again,

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,859
"Come on, let's get to coding",
but this is really important because

4
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:16,159
we need to understand what problems we had

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,240
in the past and how we found solutions to those
problems and where we are at now. We need to understand

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,649
what this whole thing of being a web developer means
and what problems we're solving and what we did

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,030
in the past and what we do today.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,559
So today we're going to talk about Tim Berners-Lee,
the person who invented the World Wide Web in 1989

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,479
and I have a picture of him right here and we're
going to talk about him because he's the first web

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,170
developer.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,829
And in order to explain that concept we need
to make a distinction between the Internet

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,130
and the World Wide Web.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,589
I have this website that I'll
share in the links below.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,350
It's really really good if you kind
of want to get a history lesson.

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,880
But essentially the Internet started off with the
Arpanet in 1969, basically a military project

16
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:01,999
and was more of a test.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,830
It connected a few universities such as
Utah, UCLA and throughout the 70s the 80s.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,050
It kept growing but there was one problem that they
had and that was essentially for the academics.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,550
They needed a way to share documents and up until
the World Wide Web existed the Internet was there

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,250
but it was really really hard for computers to
communicate with each other to share academic papers

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,410
between each other.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,650
Most of the time each computer
had their own way of doing things.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,379
Or you can think of this as languages so it's kind
of like communicating with people from different

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,090
countries and a language
that you don't know.

25
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,449
Yeah sure you can make it work
but it's very very difficult.

26
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,160
So that was the problem.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,019
And Tim Berners-Lee what he did and he was working
at CERN at the time he actually created the World

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:00,980
Wide Web and what the worldwide web is it's the
'www' that we see whenever we type in Google.com

29
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,080
over here.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,899
Is essentially a common language
that computers can speak.

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,989
With the worldwide web saying hey from now on
everybody if we want to communicate together if we

32
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:18,229
want to share images or if you want to share files
let's just have this agreed upon language agreed

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,309
upon protocol in order to
share these documents together.

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,540
So that's what it is

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,569
those servers the HTML, CSS, Javascript, the browsers
all work on top of the World Wide Web so you can

36
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,989
think of it as the Internet as your phone and the
World Wide Web is Instagram that runs on your phone.

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,500
So it's essentially a
decentralized application.

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,660
Now, how is Tim Berners-Lee
the first web developer?

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,519
He actually created the first browser and the
first server and later on we're actually going to

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,060
talk about what he did with
the files over here as well.

41
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:59,460
But he created the very very first server and
web browser but also the first web site.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,280
And they actually still have a copy of it.

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,309
This is the very first web
site ever and it's from 1991.

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,789
And this is what it looked like, and he created this
ability for people to communicate and link to other

45
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:20,359
documents, so that we have this growing knowledge
base of the world. In the next lesson we're going to

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,520
be talking about the
history of these files,

47
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,540
What they mean, what problem they solved, and how
they came to be. I'll see you in the next one.

48
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,319
Bye-bye.
