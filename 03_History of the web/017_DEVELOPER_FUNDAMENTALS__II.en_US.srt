00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,960
And welcome back to the second
'Web-developer Fundamentals'.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,599
Another very important aspect
of being a web developer

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,710
and that is the fact that we
have multiple web browsers.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,289
Now if you remember Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of
the worldwide web created it because we needed a

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:28,569
standard way to share documents amongst each other,
and through HTML, CSS and Javascript we're able

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,840
to read these files and actually
have beautiful websites.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,170
Now, when we send these files over

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,580
Each of these browsers

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,560
read the HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
and layout the web-page for us.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,420
But as you can see each one of them is owned
by a company, and is a different browser.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,130
So that means they all have to agree on how they're
going to read the HTML, CSS, and Javascript, because

12
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:09,200
if they don't all agree, then well, we need to create
different files specific for each browser, because

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,210
each one of them has a different idea
of what HTML, CSS, and Javascript is.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
And you know what?

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,709
When the World Wide Web got started we had something
called, 'the browser wars' where each browser was

16
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,799
kind of doing its own thing
implementing different things.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,459
And we still have that to this day, to some extent,
there is a governing body which kind of creates

18
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,270
the standards now. But it is still a pain point
for developers, where we need to figure out that

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:47,349
whenever we send our files to the web browser, it all
looks the same. And that is one of the biggest problems

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,870
we have as developers and you'll see tools later
on in this course that try to solve that issue.

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,239
But you'll always encounter this problem, where we
want to make sure that wherever your browser gets

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:07,059
rendered, anybody can see your website, and not only
that we also have mobile phones now that access

23
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,540
the Internet.

24
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,620
We have iPads.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,969
So now, not only do we have to worry about different
browsers, and whether they agree on what code works

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,160
in each of these files.

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,229
We also have to make sure that our web sites look
good on small screens on big screens on all sorts

28
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,199
of different screens, and that is a very important
concept something that, when you get to become a web

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,099
-developer you'll encounter this problem where you
have to test on each device, each browser to make

30
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,650
sure everything works. And we'll use some tools that
have developed over the years to solve these problems

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,710
so that it's not as much as a pain
point as it is or as it was. All right,

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,320
one more lesson to go and then we're going
to get coding. See you on the other side.
