1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,359
And welcome back!

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,039
In the last section we talked about the world wide
web and the Internet and what the differences were

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,620
and then I promised you that we'd finally
talk about some HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,249
So I've been vaguely referencing these files and
just told you that they're simple text files for now

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,680
but what are they specifically.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,249
Well initially if you remember we had Tim Berners-Lee,
who created the very first website and this

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,460
Website uses

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,150
HTML, and HTML -

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,669
that's the first file over here, is a way for us to
just write text on websites and these text on web

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,400
sites can also have these things called hyperlinks
that can link to other parts of the website.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:56,349
So that's what happened in 1991. 1991, we had a way for
us to share documents and this can link to another

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,990
website,

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,220
another file, another research paper. But,
as you can see it wasn't the prettiest.

14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,280
So in 1995 - 1996 two
technologies came into being.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,690
One was CSS and one is Javascript.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,470
Now what did they allow you to do?

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:21,549
Well CSS solved the problem of, well this is nice and
all, but wouldn't it be nice if we had some visual

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:28,630
aspects we can toy around with this website, make it
look pretty and then Javascript said, well you know

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:35,079
ideally we'll be able to have something like this
website where you know I can click over here I can

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:43,569
'Shop Now', I can put in my credit card and get these
fancy slippers and I can do all these interactive

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,700
things with my website.

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:53,859
So let's play around with this and try and incorporate
from this basic HTML file to add some CSS, and

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,420
Javascript to this page.

24
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,770
The way we're going to do that is we're going to go into
'View', 'Developer', and 'Developer Tools'. you must

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,290
- you might remember this
from our previous lessons.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,319
So once you click on that you'll get this pop up at
the bottom of the screen, for some of you might be

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,100
on the right side but it doesn't
matter you'll get both things.

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,720
And we've seen this before and if you
look at the top over here it says 'HTML'.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,490
And that's it.

30
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,479
HTML is this, it's this file that has this weird
syntax that describes how this web page should look in

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,870
text.

32
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,170
You can see over here,
it says 'The World Wide Web'.

33
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,609
These are just text. On the right side,

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,860
over here, you'll see something called styles. So
styles will actually let you add styles to the website,

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,300
as the name suggests
and that's what CSS is.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:55,640
If we click on 'HTML' here and actually, let's click on
'body' without knowing any CSS or anything, if we define

37
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:06,389
something like color, semicolon, and then let's go 'blue',
it changes the text color to blue. Chrome lets you

38
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:14,440
play around with websites and actually inject some
CSS into this HTML. Without knowing any CSS,

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,769
we can kind of play around, type in a letter and it
will have a dropdown. So let's see over here if we

40
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:28,050
can do 'background-color', lets make it in our press
tab and to do 'red', make the website really, really,

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,769
well, frankly, pretty ugly. But thats CSS right here
- we've just added some CSS to this basic website.

42
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,260
Let's turn this red color
off, because it is not pretty.

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,060
OK.

44
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,050
So HTML, text, and links,
CSS, pretty colors.

45
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,840
Now how can we add some Javascript?

46
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,530
So remember we have three files over here.

47
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,230
Javascript came along
and said these are great.

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,199
You know we have these beautiful text websites that
link to other pages and we have CSS that, its, you

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,389
you can make websites
really, really pretty.

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,279
But would it be nice to have some interactivity to
have drop-down menus to make websites like they

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,698
are now, interactive.

52
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,939
We can actually do this again
with the developer tools.

53
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,760
If you click on 'Console' over here, without knowing
any bit of Javascript, for now, we're just going to

54
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:28,030
show you a simple Javascript line, and we're going
to type in 'alert' and let's say "hi there!!!",

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,190
and I press enter and look at that.

56
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:42,309
We just made the very first website
ever made, interactive with Javascript.

57
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,940
Now obviously this doesn't do anything, but
hopefully this shows you where we were before

58
00:04:48,810 --> 00:05:01,340
in 1991 to where we are now, websites that are
interactive, full of Javascript CSS and of course HTML.

59
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,800
See you in the next one, bye.
