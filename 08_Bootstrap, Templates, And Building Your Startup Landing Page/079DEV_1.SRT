00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,800
Welcome back to another developer fundamentals video. You know who we haven't seen in a while.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,890
My friend Jean-Claude Van Damme. How are you doing these days Jean?

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,530
All right.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,620
So what is this developer fundamental there we're going to teach? Well I have over here.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:27,590
Animate.CSS and this is another CSS file that we can download to animate things.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,780
So all I need to do is click 'Download Animate.css' and I have the CSS file

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,420
downloaded for me.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,670
So let's open that up.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,610
You'll see over here that yep this is a massive CSS file that I just downloaded. And this is how Bootstrap

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,690
that we've seen in previous videos, works.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,690
They're essentially providing a CSS file for us with all these properties already preset.

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,610
And we also have all the classes that we need to use them.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,650
So let's say I wanted to use this and I'm just going to copy this for now.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,100
And I have an empty website and I'm going to copy and paste the CSS for us.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,070
Just think about how powerful that is.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:23,750
We're able to not start from scratch but use what other people have created to make our websites faster.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,530
To show you this

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:33,010
let's open up this file (index.html) into our browser. OK it's completely empty.

19
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:43,530
And let's just have a 'h1' Animate Me '/h1'. I'm going to save and refresh and looking at

20
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,900
Animate.css I can add the. Let's add bounce to our header.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,450
All we need to do is click on something like 'View on GitHub' and it will explain for us what we can

22
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,880
add and I'll just save you the trouble of reading.

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:10,720
But all we need to do is this. Copy and add the class animated and then whatever animation we want.

24
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,420
In this library

25
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,440
that's how it works.

26
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:22,060
You just need to say a class and type animated first and then any of the actions that were provided

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,020
on the website.

28
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,810
So in our case it was 'h1 class="animated infinite bounce" '. Save and refresh and..

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,030
Well we haven't linked our style sheet here so let's do that.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,390
And we should be really good at this by now because we've done it plenty of times. Save and refresh.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,480
Look at that. our header is now animated.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,140
Let's see what else we can do with this.

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,480
We can do jello.

34
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,170
Actually let's do something more exciting maybe flip, wow I like that one.

35
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,750
OK. So we want to do flip.

36
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,120
We can type in 'flip' and refresh here.

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,060
You see that? Let's do that infinite, so we can see it.

38
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,310
Wooo there you go.

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm going to stop that because that's going to get us dizzy. Refresh.

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,920
There you go.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,900
Now the fundamental here that I want to show you is that when we're building websites it is very rare

42
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,660
that we build something from scratch.

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,590
Most of the time you want to build on top of something that has already been created.

44
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,280
Otherwise the whole environment of being a developer would be very very tedious.

45
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,500
How much of a waste is it if somebody has already created a solution that you need.

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,710
So as a developer you want to be efficient with your time and your limited resources.

47
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,960
So you want to find things like Bootstrap or even Animate.CSS if they solve your certain problems.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,500
And that is true for CSS as well as JavaScript when we get into it.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:11,130
You want to find solutions that already exist and only if they don't exist already

50
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,190
then you can implement your own.

51
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,020
Finally I want to show you one other tool and that is creative tim.

52
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:29,440
So if you click on 'Creative Tim'. They create Bootstrap themes.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:38,480
They're using the Bootstrap toolkit to build their own styles and their own little customized actions

54
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,020
to make it even better.

55
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,360
So if I go to 'Categories' over here and we'll do 'UI kits' you'll see over here that they have all these

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,160
things that we can use.

57
00:04:49,220 --> 00:05:01,300
So if we click on 'Paper Kit 2 PRO'. Let's find a free one actually if I click on 'price low to high'.

58
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,410
There you go we have our 'Get Shit Done' and we also have 'Paper Kit 2'.

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,960
So if I click on this and I'm going to make this full screen. This allows us to build something like

60
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:25,500
this very very easily with their own custom design and all we need to do is do a free download. And you'll

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060
see that when we download this

62
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,700
we have all the files that we need.

63
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
And let's open it up.

64
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,570
Look at that.

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:46,350
We have this website that just like Bootstrap we can use these buttons and these different styles and

66
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,990
navigation, progress bars and forms and everything that you need.

67
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:59,220
And because we know now, how html files and CSS files work we can actually start customizing this

68
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,120
and we can open up an index.html file and start editing.

69
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:12,560
Or if we go into assets and CSS. We can start adding our own CSS values to it.

70
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:21,900
And you'll see a lot of developers that do this exactly they're freelancers and people need just

71
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,580
websites built and they're able to build websites really really fast by using something like

72
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,960
Creative Tim. Because as you can see they've already built really nice looking components for you.

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,670
There's paid ones that you can get and that is one avenue that you can go.

74
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,070
But I do argue that these type of websites can only take you so far.

75
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:54,320
And in order to build real applications, real complex applications and even garner higher salaries and

76
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:01,520
make your skills really valuable. We need to learn JavaScript and we need to become better than just

77
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,050
using templates and CSS.

78
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:11,360
And that's what we're going to get into the next section that is JavaScript that is when the real power

79
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,340
comes. See you in that one, bye bye.
