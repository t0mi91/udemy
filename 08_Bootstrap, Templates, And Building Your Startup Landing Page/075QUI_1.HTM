I recommend you watch the first video <strong>Exercise:&nbsp;Putting Your Website Online</strong> without following along yourself. This is because there is now an easier way to put a website online that I will show with the updated <strong>Exercise:&nbsp;Putting Your Website Online 2</strong>. However, I kept the original video in here because it is still a valid and useful method! Enjoy them both but I recommend only following along with the second method!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
