1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,190
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,969
I want to show you another easier way
to put your page online on GitHub.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,570
That is fairly new.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,399
All we need to do is
click on a new repository.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,439
We can create whatever we want.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,350
"startup-of-the-year"
we'll call it that for now.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,179
We'll make sure it's public.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,360
We can add a description if we want.

9
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:29,144
And we can initialize this
repository with a "README".

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,640
Now if I click Create repository

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,340
I now have an empty project

12
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:43,364
and all we need to do here
is click on upload files

13
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:47,929
and we can just drag and drop our files.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,590
In my case I can just grab these
three files we've been working on.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,719
Drag them over here.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,120
It's going to upload them and
we'll just hit commit changes

17
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:02,044
and check it out once that's done

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,770
we have our page.
Now in order for this to work

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,380
we have to make sure that
there's an index.html file

20
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,804
and all we need to do is now go to Settings

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,999
scroll all the way down
to GitHub Pages right here

22
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:25,923
select the source as the master branch

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,049
and don't worry we're gonna go
over GitHub and how it works.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,309
Later on the course we have
a dedicated section for it.

25
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,653
but I just want to make sure
that we can put things online

26
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,459
so you can show off to your friends.

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,089
If I scroll back to GitHub Pages now

28
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:45,020
you'll see that I have your site is
ready to be published right here.

29
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:50,800
So I can actually copy this link
or click on it and look at that.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,130
At this URL my website is now online.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,420
And as you can see it
works just like we had.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,470
But this time it's an
actual website online.

33
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,980
So this link I can send to
my friends and show off.

34
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,110
Now one thing I like to do here when I
create a page on GitHub is to copy this link

35
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,934
go back to the project

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,310
and add it to the description
here as the website.

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,850
So that in the future

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,760
I can just click on here and
I'm directed to my website.

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,370
All right.

40
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:42,150
That was a lot of work but congratulations
you have your website online.

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,119
Go share with your friends with your
family with your dog with your enemies

42
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:49,870
and I'll see you in the
next video. Bye bye.
