1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,070
All right.
It's time to talk about layout.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,509
Now we already learned how
will layout works in Bootstrap.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,040
And we talked about why
Bootstrap became so popular.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,450
Now don't worry.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,840
Later on in the course I'm going to
introduce you to topics like CSS Grid

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,349
and actually talk about really
easy ways to do layout on a page.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,190
But for now we want us to use Bootstrap
because that's what we learned.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,839
And I'm warning you this is
going to seem very overwhelming.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,100
I want to show you how
Bootstrap does layout because

10
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:39,144
down the road when I introduce
you to things like CSS Grid

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,479
you're going to see how much easier we have
it now than we had maybe a few years ago

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,209
But I still want you to learn how layout is
done in Bootstrap because you will encounter it

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,800
throughout your career.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,279
Now if you go to the layout section
on the Bootstrap documentation

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,140
you see over here that it has
some pretty good information.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,110
We can look at the grids and we've
already talked about how grid

17
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:03,334
works with Bootstrap.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,060
Now the first thing we want to do is to
have a container and then maybe some rows

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,169
that we can use columns on.

20
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:18,993
So if we go back to our page and
we open up the "index.html" file.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,449
The first thing I want
to do around the body.

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,919
And one thing I'll do with my Sublime Text
here is actually minimize the head tag here

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,967
just so we can see a little bit.

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,190
So I'm going to just click
on this and look at that!

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,940
It's minimized so I can
just focus on the body.

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,409
The first thing I want to do is
say that I want to create a "div"

27
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:40,133
with a class of "container".

28
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,257
Just like that.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,320
And then we'll close this right over here.

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,460
So let's indent that properly.

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,470
Let's save and refresh. Allright

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,489
we have everything in a container.

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,630
Next is that we want to ideally
all of these things to be in a row.

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,799
So we want the "h1" the "hr" and
the "button" to just be a row

35
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:08,100
one row that we have that is
in the center of the page.

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,280
So I'm just going to wrap this in a "div"

37
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:19,004
and give it a class of "row" so
once again let's close the "div"

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,709
and indent this again.

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,085
If I refresh

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,799
not much has changed we may have lost the "hr"
we'll get back to that in a second but we

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,140
have a "row" now. So that if I inspect
let's say view developer tools

42
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,279
and I click on this inspect
I see, well, these elements.

43
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,503
If I go over here and let's open this up.

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,790
Make this a little bit smaller.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,100
We see that we have the "body" we have
the "div" which is the "container"

46
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:58,424
and then we have the "row" right here.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,710
All right let me close this.

48
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:05,314
Let's divide up these items
into different sections.

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,690
We have the "header"
element that we can use.

50
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,569
And this header element will
contain the "h1" over here.

51
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,189
So we have the "header" and one thing that
we can use with Bootstrap is a class called

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,670
"text-center" and "text-center"
as you might guess.

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,880
If I refresh
centers the text.

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,880
So that's great.

55
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:34,229
That's our "header" element.

56
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,610
And we also want to create
another section here.

57
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,130
Let's call it "section".

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,140
So this is a "section" element

59
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:51,924
and this section element will
also have the class "text-center".

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,229
So if I refresh.
There you go.

61
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,900
We got our "hr" horizontal line back.

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Hmm.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,330
Why isn't this center?
Let's inspect this and find out.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,039
So I can open developer tools by pressing
CMD+OPT+I

65
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,663
or CTRL+SHIFT+I
if you're on a windows

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,230
and let's look at the elements we
have the "container" we have the "row"

67
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,710
we have the "header" and
then we have the "section".

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,250
Mm hmm.

69
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:31,030
Now we see over here that these
ones aren't taking up the full width

70
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,054
as we would want of the container.

71
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,320
And we've seen this before with Bootstrap.

72
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,390
Right.

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,940
We have to use this columns to tell it hey
we want to contain or expand along the call

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,830
and because Bootstrap uses a 12 grid system we can
just say in here in the header we want the column

75
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,000
12 grid and then for the section
we want the column 12 grid.

76
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,839
So if I refresh. There you go!
Look at that!

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,639
If I go over here I see
that we have the "row"

78
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:14,163
we have the "header" and then we have
the text which as you can see contains

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,540
the full amount of the container in
the blue. That's looking a lot better.

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,250
That's great.

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,079
Now if I close this. Hmm!
Our text and button it's still at the top.

82
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,410
Ideally it's in the middle of the image.

83
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,960
How can we fix this?

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,380
Now this part is really really tricky.

85
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,030
If I actually search
vertical alignment here

86
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:47,894
you'll see that Bootstrap has
some vertical alignment options

87
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,300
but these ones are using inline,
inline-block, inline-table

88
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:55,224
 which is actually not the recommended way.

89
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,660
Now the way we're going to do
this is we're going to use flex.

90
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,150
And this is a new feature with Bootstrap.

91
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:10,235
Because they're using the flexbox
utilities that we've learned about.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,620
Right.

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,399
So if I go over here you can see that
I can activate the flexbox system

94
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:20,523
by using the "d-flex" class.

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,300
So if I copy this and go to container
and say "d-flex" if I refresh.

96
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,190
All right.

97
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:33,049
Nothing happened because
we've just enabled flexbox.

98
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:37,673
But now we want to make
sure that we can place

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,069
things vertically in the center

100
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:49,413
and this if we scroll down is what
we want right here "align-items".

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,250
If we look over here it's
"align-items-center".

102
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:03,270
So if I copy this which is this one over
here and we add "align-items-center".

103
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:04,894
If I refresh.

104
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,720
This isn't working and
this is a little tricky.

105
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,760
And I'm showing you this just to
understand how to debug things.

106
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,239
So let's say you just did
this and for some reason

107
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,800
You don't understand why this isn't
working on the documentation page.

108
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,120
Clearly it shows us that this should
be working. Well we can inspect.

109
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,310
So let's right click inspect and
have a look at our HTML page.

110
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,800
We have the container and then the body.

111
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,230
Now you see here how
everything is in the container.

112
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,369
And as a matter of fact

113
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,449
If we look at the container we're actually
aligning items in the center because

114
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,850
the container is actually
not the full page.

115
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,489
It's only the top part.

116
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,450
Right.

117
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,970
It's just this part.

118
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:02,850
So here the container is
not fully covering the page.

119
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,369
So what we need to do

120
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:11,489
just like we have in body if we look at style
here you see how we have height of 100%.

121
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,650
All we need to do is tell the container that
hey I want you to span the entire height

122
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,400
of the page and then Bootstrap

123
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,460
we can do that by saying "h-100"
instead of adding the CSS stuff.

124
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:28,884
If I save this and refresh.

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,310
Look at that!

126
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,650
If I hover.

127
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,300
You'll see that my container is
now the full length of the page

128
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:40,324
and our writing is right in the middle.

129
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,820
If I scroll up or down look at
that it's adjusting properly.

130
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,920
Everything is centered.
That's great!

131
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,919
Now don't worry if this takes
you a long time to figure out.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,169
Sometimes it involves googling
around figure things out

133
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:01,893
Like it said later on in the
CSS layout section of the course

134
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,060
I'll actually show you how
to make this so much simpler.

135
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,470
Now the last thing I want
to do is well right here

136
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:13,380
I want to have a bit of space
between the writing and the button.

137
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,090
So what can we do here?

138
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,349
I want to another section
in between these two

139
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:23,373
to hopefully buffer them away
from each other so we can

140
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,019
create that fairly easily.

141
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:32,103
We can just add a new div and we'll give
it a class here of "buffer" that we'll

142
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,819
have to write ourselves.

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:41,209
In this buffer class will be in between
the header and then the horizontal line

144
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,190
and the button.

145
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,989
So let's also give this a column of 12.

146
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:49,513
Because we want to make sure
that it covers the entire area.

147
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,129
But right now there's nothing.

148
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,040
If I right click here and inspect.

149
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,219
You'll see here that I have the buffer
but the buffer doesn't have anything.

150
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,090
It's completely empty because
well there's nothing inside here.

151
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:11,014
But we can add a style let's say ".buffer".

152
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,900
In this "buffer" will have a
height of what should we say.

153
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:25,220
Well if I do let's say "50px" and I refresh.
Look at that! I get a nice little buffer.

154
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,290
So now if I scroll over to buffer you
see that I have a 50px height buffer.

155
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:36,900
But I always like using "rem"
instead of "px"s so let's do "rem".

156
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,929
Let's see what "5rem" means.

157
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,160
All right.

158
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,080
That's good.

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,839
Maybe a little bit more.

160
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,729
Let's do "10rem". Let's save and refresh.

161
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,120
All right.

162
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,900
That looks actually quite nice.

163
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,310
If I close this down open it up.

164
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,070
Yeah.

165
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,680
Look at that.

166
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,880
Now looks really really nice.

167
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,040
And there we go.

168
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,010
We have our startup
landing page right here.

169
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,170
Everything looks pretty nice right.

170
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,000
And the way we've organized
things seems pretty clean.

171
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,279
Our button is well when
we hover available but

172
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:18,003
whenever I click on this
button nothing's happening.

173
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,960
Ideally we have a new page that opens up

174
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:26,964
so that we can enter or our
customers can enter their e-mails.

175
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,560
And this is the exciting part that
we're going to get to in the next video.

176
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,584
I'll see in that one. Bye bye.
