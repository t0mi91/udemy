1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,490
All right.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,510
Let's get going here now the first thing
we want to do is change this hello to.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,920
Well the biggest startup event of the year.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,790
Very dramatic.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,140
I know.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,260
So let's do that.

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm just going to say the biggest
startup event of the year.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,770
That's right.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,410
OK.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,169
Let's save.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,152
So I'm doing "Command+S"
or if you're on Windows, "Ctrl+S"

12
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:30,439
and then refresh
"Command+R" or if you're on

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,040
windows "Ctrl+R".

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,080
All right.
There we go.

15
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,259
That's great.

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,640
We also seem to have a button
that says find out more.

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,310
So let's do that as well.

18
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,890
We'll say "button".

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,599
Find out more.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
There we go.

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,570
If I refresh here.

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,390
There you go.

23
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:56,610
Our startup landing page is well
frankly still looking fairly ugly.

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,789
Now the next thing we want to do is
we want to have this background image.

25
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,889
But before we get to that

26
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,920
I want to talk a little bit about
how we can set up our HTML page

27
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,649
so that we have good responsive design.

28
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,539
So right now nothing much is going on.

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,389
You can see here that I
can adjust the screen size.

30
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,089
But we don't have much
happening on our page.

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,930
So if we go back to the
Bootstrap documentation

32
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,739
in the quick start guide if I
scroll all the way to the bottom

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,509
you see that I get a starter template here

34
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,430
and you might notice here something
that we haven't seen before

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,180
which is this part over here
called a "required meta tag"

36
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,589
and you can see here that this is actually

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,870
something that we can copy and paste
and place right below our title here.

38
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,110
Just like that.

39
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,829
Now let's make this a little
bit bigger so we can see

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,629
and I'll make the writing
smaller just so you

41
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,539
can see over here exactly what's happening.

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,030
So this meta tag allows us to

43
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:10,849
add new information to our HTML page
and there's different things that

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,300
we can provide.

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,370
Now in most websites you'll actually see these two
lines very often as a matter of fact it's recommended

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,550
that you always add.

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,260
Now what exactly do they do?

48
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:31,044
Well if we scroll down here you'll see
that we have the "responsive meta tag".

49
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,948
Essentially

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,720
this line here which says viewport
allows us to create web pages

51
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:41,279
that are developed mobile first.

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,189
That is we let the page
know or the browser know

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,589
that this page should work
on mobile devices and things

54
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,230
like scrolling or touching or zooming

55
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:58,699
on a mobile device is going
to work with this tag.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,029
Now this is something I'm going to
leave for you to learn more about

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,230
and it's something we'll talk
about later in the course

58
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,662
but these meta tags are
just useful things to add

59
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:13,930
to our projects anytime
we create a new page.

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,949
And then finally this top meta tag

61
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,070
uses UTF-8 encoding essentially
it's saying hey we're going to use

62
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,090
this form of encoding to
write text on our pages.

63
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:29,979
Again something that if you're
curious you can read up on your own.

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,020
But now that we've set this up so
that it's good for mobile as well.

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,339
Let's try to include this
background image into our page.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,039
Now when it comes to
background images on a website

67
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,070
that's a very common thing.

68
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,649
You'll see a lot of people adding
background images to a website

69
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,980
or maybe patterns or some sort of colors

70
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:59,219
and when a common problem
happens I always like well, Google

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,230
and one of the first things
that you'll encounter

72
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,139
is this perfect full page
background image by "CSS-TRICKS"

73
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
which we've seen before.

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,019
Now if you scroll all the way down

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,019
it tells us a way for us to make
sure that we use the image in a

76
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,909
full page background so that it stretches
it flexes as the view port changes.

77
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,030
Now over here it actually
gives us a copy and paste

78
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,569
way that we can use it ourselves.

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,039
So I'm going to just copy this

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,699
go to my style page and
just add this to our CSS.

81
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,269
Now you'll see over here that we're using
"background" over here with the "url".

82
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,049
So we want to adjust it to "header.jpg"

83
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,849
Because that's the url of the header.

84
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,669
And the key here is these lines.

85
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,693
It saying hey we don't
want to repeat the image

86
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,560
we want you to keep it centered
and we want you to keep it fixed.

87
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,239
And by using this line it stretches
or at least it fills the entire page

88
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:17,850
with our image and as long as we
have "background-size" as "cover".

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,190
Well let's see what happens.

90
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,220
I'm going to refresh.

91
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,199
Hey and look at that!

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,390
Now I have this image

93
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:30,065
that adapts to our page.

94
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,050
But the cool part is if I
open the developer tools here.

95
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:41,974
Let's say view developer tools you'll
notice that the image actually bumps up

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,780
so that the center of the
image well is always centered.

97
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,539
How cool is that!

98
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,630
So this is a very useful trick to
have your background very flexible.

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:57,960
All right.

100
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,469
So we have our background, hmmm!

101
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,130
Unfortunately our writing right now is
hard to see the button still kind of ugly.

102
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,260
So let's fix a few things in our HTML page.

103
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,239
Now remember we have Bootstrap so we
can start using some Bootstrap classes now.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,930
One thing that I want to do is

105
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:26,439
with this "h1" tag I want to maybe use a
"strong" element to emphasize the header.

106
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,370
So make sure we close this and I'm gonna
make this bigger just so you can see.

107
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,089
And if I refresh.

108
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,113
All right that's emphasized
a little bit more.

109
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,029
We also want to make sure that
this "h1" tag we can actually see

110
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,053
So we can go into our style

111
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:50,860
and just create a new "h1" style that
will have a let's say a "font-size"

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,700
of let's say "3rem".

113
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:03,817
And then we'll give it a "color"
of, what should we do here?

114
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,079
Well one thing that I always like to do when
I'm trying to figure out what color I want

115
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:10,103
is to

116
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:15,124
go to a page let's say
like the startup over here

117
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,148
open up the developer tools

118
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,309
make sure this is a little
bit bigger so we can see

119
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:27,033
and then find somewhere on the page
where you have this color palette.

120
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,029
If I actually click on
this and I'm on Chrome

121
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:34,153
Look at that! It opens up a
little color palette for us

122
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,269
so I can actually move around things

123
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:41,693
and grab the hacks of
the color that I want.

124
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,170
In our case I want the color
to be well let's find out.

125
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:47,894
How can I copy the color of this page?

126
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,260
I can just click on select an element.

127
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,240
This little icon here.

128
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,390
And then if I hover over this look at that.

129
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,330
It shows me exactly what
color this element has.

130
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,810
You can see over here that
this is the hex color.

131
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,730
So I'm just going to copy that
come back and paste it in.

132
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,530
Now if I save both of these files
and refresh that's much better.

133
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,570
I like that a lot.

134
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,479
All right.

135
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,060
We're making progress with our page.

136
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,709
It's getting closer but
we still have a lot to do.

137
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,991
So let's take a break and I'll
see you in the next video.
