1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:04,119
So how are we going to
build this from scratch

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,919
based on what we've learned so far.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,079
Well we're going to use Bootstrap
for this because we just learned it

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,379
and I actually gave you some starter files
attached to the last lesson.

6
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:17,519
If we take a look.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,660
That's right.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,140
We had a header image.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,059
We had an "index.html" file
and then a "style.css" file.

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:31,410
So you can open these make sure
they're all in the same folder.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,579
I called mine "startup" with an exclamation
mark because this is an exciting project

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,170
and in our case
we'll use Sublime Text.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
We should have something like this.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,325
So we have our "index.html" file
our "style.css" and then

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,290
our header image.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,139
Now I filled in a few things
for you just to get us started.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,920
Nothing too crazy though.

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,180
Don't worry.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,676
One is we've used some
Google fonts so that we can

20
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:05,159
use this "Montserrat" font
which I think is kind of

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,420
nice from the Google fonts

22
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:11,144
and we enable that
in our style sheet by saying body and HTML.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,630
I want to make sure that
the font family has this setting.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,060
If not we'll use "sans-serif".

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,419
I've also set width and height for "100%".

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,478
That's always something
good to have to make sure

27
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,719
that the body and HTML cover
100 percent of whatever

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,700
we see on the screen.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,880
Next we have our "Bootstrap CSS" from a
"CDN" or a "Content Delivery Network".

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,787
And the reason I've added this
here, is that so you don't have to

31
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:44,690
actually include a Bootstrap file yourself.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,269
If I actually go to the Bootstrap page
and I go to "Quick Start"

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,769
you'll see that right here we can just copy

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,760
and paste this, just like here
with the Bootstrap CSS file.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,410
So that way right away as soon
as we copy and paste this line

36
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:05,389
we have Bootstrap available to us.

37
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,790
Now notice here how we have
versions of Bootstrap.

38
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:12,017
In this case it's "4.3.1".

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,141
Now this number as the
time passes is going to get

40
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,365
bigger and bigger.
Because Bootstrap is a constantly

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,860
evolving library
as developers make updates.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,025
But as long as you use
a number higher than this

43
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:28,527
everything in this
project should work.

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,129
Like I said most of the time no matter

45
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,029
when you're watching this video
as long as you copy this

46
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,420
or you use my starter files
everything should work.

47
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,050
And then finally we have our style sheet.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,170
Nothing new here right.

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,050
Because we've already seen this before
we have our "style.css" file

50
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:49,459
and our style file just has
this for now.

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,160
We also have our header image which
again is a nice little laptop image

52
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:57,184
for our startup landing page.

53
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,109
Now this is the website over here that is
completely blank because we have nothing in the body.

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,770
So let's just have a "h1" that says
"Helllloooooo" right here.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,920
Save it and refresh.

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,670
Look at that! We have

57
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,270
"Helllloooooo"

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,749
Now notice here how
fast I did that I just

59
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,680
pressed "Command+R" on
my laptop which is a Mac.

60
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,373
If you have Windows it's
"Ctrl+R" to refresh the web

61
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:28,699
page and you notice here
that the font is being

62
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,540
applied once again because
we have our font-family CSS set.

63
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,728
So there's our page,
our setup and there is what we

64
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,919
want to get to now if you
want you can go off on

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,569
your own and try to attempt to
built this from scratch yourself.

66
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,070
Otherwise I'll see you in the next video

67
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:53,994
to actually get our page to
look a little bit more like this

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,410
and less like this.

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,110
I'll see in the next one.
Bye bye.
