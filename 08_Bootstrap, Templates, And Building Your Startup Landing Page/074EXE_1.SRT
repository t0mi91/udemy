1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,620
All right everybody.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,039
This is the exciting part!

3
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:09,903
Because up until now, well we've
created our startup landing page.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,030
It looks great but it's
only on our laptops.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,690
Right.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,809
If you're starting a business you're
not going to go to every customer.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,160
Give them your laptop and say "Hey
check out my startup landing page".

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,689
No we want to use the Internet right.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,060
We want to be able to
put this website online.

10
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:30,984
But we also want people to
be able to click on this and

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,370
have a way to submit their email address

12
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,454
so that maybe when your startup
launches you can email them

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,830
and ask them to make a purchase.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,269
So this is the fun part!

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,920
Now that we've created the page.
How can we make it interactive?

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,899
Well for this section we're going
to use something called MailChimp

17
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:56,630
and MailChimp is an
e-mail marketing service.

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,240
There's other tools like
MailerLite and a ton of others

19
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:04,464
that allow you to have
this exact functionality

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,569
a way for users to click on a
button, submit a form

21
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:11,874
and save that information
somewhere for you to use later.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,200
Now in order for this part to work

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,750
we need to create an account and
sign up for free with MailChimp.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,340
Now I've already gone through the steps
so you don't have to watch me type along

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,070
But just a heads up what we're
going to do it is completely free

26
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,094
isn't going to cost you anything.

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,389
But we do want to create
an account with MailChimp.

28
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:42,400
So that we can create our e-mail form.
So I want you to go ahead do this.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,189
It might ask you for your home address

30
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:48,713
and that is actually a requirement
especially in some parts of

31
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,659
the world where to avoid
spam and spam bots.

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,389
You have to provide your home address

33
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:59,913
or some sort of an address so that
they know that you are a real human

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,100
who is asking people to
sign up to their newsletter.

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,124
But just go through the steps here.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,780
Just create your password get started.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,170
You might have to confirm
your account with your e-mail.

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,260
But it should take you no
longer than five minutes.

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,490
Once you have done that
you can pause the video.

40
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,540
Otherwise let's sign-in to MailChimp.

41
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,029
Now one thing actually before we
sign-in is if you look at the pricing

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,949
there is a free tier and this is where we're
going to use where we can just create a form.

43
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,150
And as long as we have less than 2000
contacts it's going to be completely free.

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,660
Again if you're creating a startup landing page and
you're getting more than 2000 people interested

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,510
well then you're probably going to make some
money so you can start paying for this service.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,719
But up until 2000 sign ups,
well it's completely free.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
So that's really really nice.

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,410
All right.

49
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,570
Once you've created an
account let's log in.

50
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,780
All right.

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,350
There we go.

52
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,040
We have our dashboard.

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,110
Now I want you to keep in mind when
you work with a service like this

54
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:09,734
which is essentially a
website online of a company

55
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,070
they're always going to
change how the website looks.

56
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,159
So when you're watching this video you
might not have the exact same look as I do.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,410
Don't worry about it.

58
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,490
Most of the core functionalities
are going to be the same.

59
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,299
You might have just different
buttons organized differently.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,060
But what we want to do is
essentially go to audience.

61
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:37,984
If you click on manage audience
click on sign up forms.

62
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,160
You can actually create your own audience.

63
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:49,284
So let's just call this one
"Zero to Mastery students".

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,860
You can have different settings such as
enabling captcha, enabling double opt-in

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,929
which again sends contact
opt-in confirmation.

66
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,290
So when people sign up they'll
get a confirmation e-mail

67
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:08,950
that they've subscribed and you
can also enable GDPR fields.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Now we don't need to
worry about that too much.

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's create a form name named
call it "Zero to Mastery".

70
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,784
You can provide a default
e-mail address if you want.

71
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,539
Scroll all the way down.

72
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:27,589
And you don't need to worry about too much let's
just save audience and campaign defaults.

73
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,010
All right.

74
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,340
We've created our list.

75
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,090
So now if I click back on audience.

76
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:37,214
You see that I have "Zero
to Mastery students".

77
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,189
If I go to campaigns now
and say create campaign

78
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:47,259
and instead of a sign-up form we're
going to click on landing page.

79
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,680
Now the landing page name
can be whatever you want.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,100
Let's say "Startup" with
an exclamation mark.

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,619
We want to target the audience
"Zero to Mastery students".

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,229
We can click begin

83
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:04,453
and here we can select
a template that we want.

84
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:09,277
Now in our case we can just
have the grow your list template

85
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,910
and you can customize
this however you want.

86
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:24,610
You can have different headings here such as
"This is the best business in the world!".

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,740
We can have a logo if you want.

88
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,059
We can use the Zero to Mastery
logo that I've already uploaded.

89
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,890
And we can just leave the email
and subscriber the way it is.

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,379
Again this website is going to let
you customize things differently

91
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,190
and depending on when you watch the video
these might be a little bit different.

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
It doesn't really matter as
long as we get this e-mail form.

93
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:55,129
So if I click save and close
and I go save and close.

94
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:05,000
We now have my startup page which I can just
add a page title let's say "Startup Idea".

95
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,170
We can add a URL.

96
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:15,954
So this allows you to have your
own custom URL if you want.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,490
But in our case we want the free
option so I can just create let's say

98
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:25,610
"ztmstudents" and point so
if I save here.

99
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,490
I now have a page title, a URL, we have the
audience which is "Zero to Mastery students"

100
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,110
we have the content which is what we just created.
And all I need to do now is say publish.

101
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,934
High five!

102
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,830
Thank you very much. Now your landing
page is now live on the web right here.

103
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:56,049
So check this out if I copy and paste
this into the link there is my page.

104
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,060
Now all we need to do is copy this link.

105
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,049
Go to my find out more.

106
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:07,873
And make it so that when a user
clicks on it it goes to that page.

107
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,150
And that's super easy, right.

108
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,109
We can just create an
"a" tag with an "href".

109
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,420
And this "href" will have
the link that we just copied.

110
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,200
So let's close that

111
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,510
close the "a" tag.

112
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,534
If I hit save

113
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,650
and refresh if I click now.

114
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,980
How cool is that!

115
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,819
But this isn't even the coolest part.

116
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,740
The coolest part is now I can
create just a random e-mail.

117
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,180
Let's say "andy1234@gmail.com".

118
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:51,289
Click subscribe and oh
we have almost finished.

119
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,259
So you see over here how I got the
you need to confirm your email address

120
00:07:55,283 --> 00:08:00,359
and that's because we clicked on that setting
where people had to confirm their email address

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,080
because well we don't want just
anybody to sign up to our newsletter

122
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,340
we want to make sure they're
human and not just bots.

123
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,070
So instead let's go back and
actually give my email address.

124
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:16,194
Subscribe
if I now go back to go to my email.

125
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,519
Hey check it out!
Look at that!

126
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,740
I have the "Zero to Mastery students".

127
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,610
Yes, subscribe me to the list.

128
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,189
So if I click on this now I'm
now subscribed to the list

129
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,213
and if I go to my campaigns.

130
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,209
You'll see that I have two
clicks on this campaign.

131
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,929
So if I now actually go to view report

132
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:48,753
I'll have a new subscriber
that if I go to audience now

133
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,759
you can see that I have a
new contact and there we go.

134
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,420
We have myself as the new subscriber.

135
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,230
And as people get more and
more interested in your startup

136
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:04,154
they're going to sign up more and more

137
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,510
and you'll be able to send them an email.

138
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,225
How cool is that!

139
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,929
Let's take a break and I'll
see you in the next video

140
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,300
so that we can actually put this website
online instead of just on our computers.

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll see you on that one. Bye bye.
