00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,530
Hello, in this video, I'm going to introduce you to something called Bootstrap, if you haven't heard

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,040
before.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,110
Bootstrap is one of the most popular projects ever for developers.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,500
And what it is, is just a access file and JavaScript file.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,000
But why would that be one of the most popular projects?

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,430
Well, one thing you might have noticed is that writing success from scratch is a bit of a pain.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,140
Wouldn't it be nice if you can use something that has already been created by somebody so that not every

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,060
single developer has to keep reinventing the wheel and keep writing everything from scratch?

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,730
And that is the idea behind bootstrap.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,240
Bootstrap was created to solve this problem so that we can create websites really, really fast by using

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,960
somebody else's success and building on top of it.

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,550
There's also another project called Foundation that does the same thing, and they have their own styles,

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,280
but again, bootstrap is the more popular of the two.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,540
So we'll focus on that if we click on get started here.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,330
I'll have a quick set up instruction and in the next video will actually build something with Bootstrap.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,600
But I want to show you, if you go down to components, what the big sell of bootstrap is, and that

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,170
is it has all of these things pre-built for you.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:34,470
So if I wanted to, let's say, have a navigation bar, well, that's already built for me with drop

19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,490
downs and links.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,900
And all I have to do is copy and paste this code.

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,470
And you'll see over here that they already have classes attached to them.

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,820
And these classes will be associated with the file that I will download from Bootstrap.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,020
So any time I use something like NFPA, it will use the default bootstrap stuff.

24
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,570
And there's many things that you can do.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,610
As you can see, all I need to do is copy and paste this code and I have myself a card.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,150
You can imagine how fast making websites is with this.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,220
Now, the one thing I do want to point out is you might be asking why do I need to also download JavaScript?

28
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,750
We haven't really learned that topic yet in this course.

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,110
And there are some things and bootstrap, such as dropdown menus, you can see how they're adding behavior,

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,470
some actions to our website.

31
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,380
If I go to, let's say, modals, for example.

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,620
And I click on launch demo model.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,150
Well, this uses JavaScript because there's some action within our website, we won't worry too much

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,590
about that and that's something we'll get into when we get to the JavaScript section.

35
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,820
But you can see here that with bootstrap, by just downloading a file and a JavaScript file, we have

36
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,900
all these tools at our disposal.

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,830
Now, you might be asking yourself one other thing, and that is, well, if everybody uses these,

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,990
won't we all have the same looking websites and know the beauty of bootstrap is that these are just

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,860
building blocks.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,130
You have all these classes that you can use, but then you can add your own custom styles on top of

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,000
this to make it different.

42
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,530
So if I go to Bundes, for example, well, by using these classes, I have all these beautiful buttons.

43
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,340
But if I wanted to change the behavior button primary, which is this one, I could create my own access

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,260
file and just put it right after the bootstrap file and change the primary color to, let's say, orange.

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:45,400
And just to show you, if you go to the Expo tab here, Bootstrap actually has a whole bunch of websites

46
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,310
that are have been built with bootstrap.

47
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,400
And you can see that they all look very, very different.

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,350
So in the next video, we're going to build ourself a bootstrap website.

49
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,010
I'll see you on that one.

50
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,030
Bye bye.
