1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,810
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,110
We left off with our really quick website that we built using Bootstrap.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:15,190
But I want to show you one thing that I've kept from you and that is the layout feature in Bootstrap.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,410
And this was the primary reason that Bootstrap was so popular because layout was so difficult and

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,840
we didn't have flexbox back in the day.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,620
Bootstrap allowed us to create very responsive websites using these ideas of columns. To show you what

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,100
I mean we're going to create our own column system.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,200
We're going to go back to our website and I'm going to delete everything that we created so far.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,470
And save and refresh. Everything's empty.

10
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,610
So in Bootstrap you can do something like this.

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,300
[div class="container"] You always want to wrap everything in a container and again if you go to the documentation 

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,730
it'll show you what to do. And we'll just grab the top ones.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,780
So let's just copy these. Fix the indentation a bit.

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,860
There you go.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,450
And if I refresh.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Well we need to have a bit of background so we can see them. So I'm going to say column '.col'

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:30,090
we'll do 'background-color: grey;' and the 'border' will be '2px solid black;' save

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,850
and go back and refresh. We have our borders.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,310
Now here's something interesting they can do.

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,130
You can do 'col-sm-6' and then 'col-sm-3'.

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,650
Don't worry I'll explain what that means.

22
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:52,610
I'm going to refresh and look at that. The size of this just got smaller and that is because Bootstrap

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,390
has the idea of a grid system and this grid system has 12 lines.

24
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,040
So six plus three is nine.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,670
So it's saying that I want this column to have six spaces out of that 12.

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:18,300
And this column to have three spaces out of that 12. So if we add another column 

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,450
and six plus three plus three is 12.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm going to say 'Extra' here I refresh you'll see that it fills in this gap. What if I put it in four here [col-sm-4].

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,210
So that is 13 which is over 12.

30
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,870
Well if I refresh this goes down to the next level.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,010
So you see how easy it is to control things in Bootstrap.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:54,320
I could also do something like 'column-xs-12' and then 'column-xs-6'

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,880
and actually will medium here [col-md-6].

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,950
Save let's refresh and see what happens.

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:16,950
Woah. What this is saying that if the size of the window is medium then I want the whole 12 grid system

36
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:25,070
to the first div and then six of the 12 to the second and then the extra one, six.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,350
So you can see here that that's medium.

38
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:35,310
But because we have these small properties in here. If I make it smaller you can see that it resorts

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,620
down to the six three four grid.

40
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's change this back to three [col-sm-3] so it looks better and show you that there's a few other

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,410
sizes that we can add.

42
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:57,600
You can see over here that we have 'Grid options' and we have Small, Medium, Large and Extra large. So let's

43
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:06,140
do large and see what happens. So for large I want to have everything on their own, so we can do this [col-lg-12]

44
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,220
and save let's refresh and see if you can guess what's about to happen.

45
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm going to go from medium to large. Do you see that? 12 12 12 so I want each div to occupy 12 spaces 12 grid sytems.

46
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,450
Which is the full thing. If I go to medium I now occupy with the first one, 12.

47
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:43,060
The second one, six and six. They should be one after another and if I go down to even smaller 

48
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,830
the small will have six, three and three.

49
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:54,350
So this is how you can create really responsive websites. And that was the biggest selling feature of

50
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,590
Bootstrap it was solving this really really hard problem of making sure that our website looked good no matter

51
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,770
what the screen size.

52
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,060
So I want you to play around with the grid options here.

53
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,980
This is the hardest concept to grasp in Bootstrap. Once youve learned this.

54
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,660
Its very very easy to create websites extremely fast.

55
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye.
