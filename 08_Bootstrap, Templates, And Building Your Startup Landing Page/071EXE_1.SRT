1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,769
All right everybody let's keep going.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,510
What else can we do to this page
to make it look more like this one.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,770
Well I want the text uppercased here.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,429
You can see over here that
this is all in capitals.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,240
This is not. I mean I could change
this if I want to capital letters.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,980
I can also add a style

7
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,919
to make everything uppercase.

8
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:31,270
But there's also another useful
one that comes with Bootstrap.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,900
I can actually add a class

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,989
and use a class in Bootstrap
called "text-uppercase".

11
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,013
If I save this and refresh.

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,950
Look at that!

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,350
Everything is uppercased.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,730
That's awesome.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,120
Now what about the button.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,290
Let's add some Bootstrap
styling to the buttons again.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,609
Let's say you don't know how to add Bootstrap
styles or you don't know the classes.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,240
We can always go to the
documentation and search buttons.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,799
There we go.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,170
We see that we have some
button classes that we can use.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,910
In our case, let's use this one.

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:24,300
Button primary. So I'm going to
copy comeback and with this button.

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,049
Let's give it a class of "btn-primary".

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:36,039
If I save and refresh. Hey look at that!
We have a Bootstrap button already.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,109
That's really really cool.

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,819
But you know what I want to
have a different color right.

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,840
I want the button to look more like this.

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,110
Something nicer so we can
add our own custom CSS.

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,800
Let's call this class

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,090
"btn-xl" or extra large button
and this isn't a Bootstrap class.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,410
If I save this and refresh
nothing will happen.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,960
Instead we can create this "btn-xl"
right here in our own style sheet.

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,329
So let's say "btn" or ".btn-xl"

34
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:19,353
is going to be let's make this
a little bit bigger is going to

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,300
have padding of let's say
"1rem" on the sides and "2rem"

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,410
top bottom.

37
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,860
If I refresh this.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,970
That's better.

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,880
That's a lot bigger.

40
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,250
So we have an extra large button.

41
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:38,114
Now we can add sizes or we can
add different properties here.

42
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,079
But since we named this class "btn-xl"

43
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:45,003
we should just leave it the
way it's describing things that

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,089
is to make the button larger.

45
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:53,313
So instead let's just modify the
existing classes that we have

46
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,940
which is the "btn" and "btn-primary".

47
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,410
So if I go back here we can
say that the "btn" class

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,190
will have a "font-weight" of let's
say "700" and a "border-radius"

49
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,979
that is to make the edges more circular.

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,610
And we'll give it "300px".

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,950
If I save this and refresh.

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,060
Mm hmm.

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,870
That's a lot better.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,600
I like that.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,950
And I want this capitalized
as well and I can use the

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,119
"text-uppercase" class as we've seen before

57
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:39,463
or I can just in here say
"text-transform" and just say "uppercase".

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,179
So just to use a CSS class. If I refresh.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,680
Mm hmm.

60
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,450
That looks really really nice.

61
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,536
Now let's keep going here.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,750
Let's add another class
here which is "btn-primary".

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,000
So we're just adding on to the
Bootstrap styles that we have

64
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:00,024
and we'll just give it a "background-color"

65
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,899
of what should we do.

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,029
Well if we go back to this page again
we inspect right here by hovering

67
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:15,473
and we click we see over here as we scroll
down what color we're using over here.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Let's see.

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
Where is the color?

70
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,700
Let's see.

71
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,580
Let's see.

72
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:25,170
Oh there it is right here.

73
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:32,610
So I'm going to copy the color add
it here. If I hit save and refresh.

74
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,610
Hey look at that!

75
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,410
That's really really nice.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,270
But one thing you'll notice
is that the border over here.

77
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:43,294
If we scroll or zoom in you see
that the border has a bit of blue.

78
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,750
And that's default for the Bootstrap theme.

79
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:52,474
So instead let's add a border as well.

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,449
So call it "border-color"
and give it the same color.

81
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:06,180
If I refresh that's much better although
now we're hovering and it's turning blue.

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,260
That's OK but I don't like it.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,950
Let's make it hover so it's still orange
but maybe a little bit darker orange.

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,130
So what can we do here?

85
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,850
Again we've seen this before.

86
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,920
We can just say "btn-primary: hover"

87
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:29,839
and in here we can just
add "background-color"

88
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,463
to be something a little
bit different than this.

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,669
In this case we're going to
use a color that is "#ee4b08".

90
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,529
Don't worry I didn't memorize this.

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,150
This is just something that, well

92
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:47,474
I knew that I used when I
made this website first.

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,900
So don't worry you never
need to memorize hex colors.

94
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,439
Next we'll do the same
for the "border-color".

95
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
So once again we'll make the
"border-color" the same as we have here.

96
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,190
That's great.

97
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,029
I also want to increase
the "border-width" actually

98
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:07,360
to just make it a little bit
bigger when we hover over it.

99
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,090
So let's just give it an
extra "4px" and let's save.

100
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:16,114
If I refresh and hover and look at that!

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,740
That's awesome so that's
looking really really nice.

102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,639
So we have the button.

103
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,959
It's looking pretty good.

104
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,209
We have our header.

105
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,330
That's looking pretty great as well.

106
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,220
The other thing I want to
add is this little line here

107
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:36,244
just to give it a little
extra flair to the page

108
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,420
and we can use something called
an "hr" here or a horizontal line.

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,330
So the "hr" tag which we
can just put in between.

110
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,020
So let's say "hr" is a horizontal line.

111
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,539
So if I refresh here I don't
know if you can see it.

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,709
Well because it's dark.

113
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,490
But let's add some styling to it.

114
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,049
So let's say in here that we
want the "hr"s on our page

115
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:07,373
to have a "border-color"
of the orange that we've

116
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,230
had before which is this one over here.

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,510
So let's say "border-color" is this.
If I save and refresh.

118
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:15,940
All right.

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,400
Look at that.

120
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,069
There's our little line.

121
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,790
It's a little thin though so
let's add a bit of sizing.

122
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,030
So I'll say

123
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:28,970
"border-witdh" and give it let's say "3px".

124
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,419
And if I refresh.

125
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,760
All right.

126
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,590
That's getting bigger.

127
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,270
That's good.

128
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,219
But I don't want this
to be the entire page.

129
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,910
I only want it a little bit
just like we see it here.

130
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,769
So we have a CSS property
here that we can use

131
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:49,993
called "max-width" which as
the name suggests tells us

132
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,870
exactly what's the maximum
width of this thing.

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,720
In our case let's say "65px".

134
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,300
So if I save this and
refresh. That's much better.

135
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:07,390
All right. We're making progress
here but there is an issue right.

136
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,370
Right now we have the content that we
want but it's all all over the place.

137
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,669
It's kind of ugly isn't it.

138
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,410
We want everything centered maybe
around this laptop over here.

139
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:20,734
And this is where Bootstrap really shines.

140
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,470
So let's figure that out in the next video.
