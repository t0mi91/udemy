1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,700
Let's start using Bootstrap. And there are two ways we can use this toolkit.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,150
One is to download and you can just click on the first link it says 'Compiled CSS and JS'.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,450
Well, let's just see what gets downloaded.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,160
So if I open this. You'll see here that I have a CSS file and JavaScript file.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,420
You see there's bunch of them.

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,220
You don't have to worry too much about it is just different CSS files that are used together based

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,800
on if you're using the Bootstrap grid or the Bootstrap CSS. And you'll see some of them have

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,230
the 'Bootstrap.min.css'

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,980
And that means that they are minified. So if I open this you'll see that everything is on one line and

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,840
minified. Right now all we need to do is just add this to our project.

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,260
But I want to show you a better way of doing it especially when we're getting started.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,220
And that is we can use something called a CDN.

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,790
And so what is a CDN? A CDN is a Content Delivery Network.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,850
Bootstrap has this link and they're hosting the Bootstrap CSS files for us.

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,210
So we don't even need to include it in our project.

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,410
All we need to do is add this line into our HTML and you'll see here that the 'link' tag which refers

17
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:32,000
to a stylesheet has an 'href' that links us to the Bootstrap minified CSS.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,650
And that's what a Content Delivery Network is.

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,410
We don't need to include our files into our project we just link to someplace else that is actually

20
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,470
hosting this file.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,960
So let's copy that. Open up Subline and I'm going to create a new file here and we'll save it to the

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,360
desktop and we'll call it 'index.html'.

23
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,890
I save. And let's open that up in the browser as well. OK.

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,670
And empty because well we don't have any.

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,910
Here, let's start with our html page and we'll title it '&lt;title&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/title&gt;'.

26
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:16,660
And again we have that link copied which is the CDN that says hey I want the CSS file from Bootstrap.

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,340
If you scroll down to the bottom it also has the JavaScript file.

28
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,270
And like I said before, we need these files if we're using features of Bootstrap such as dropdowns or

29
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,990
modals that actually add some actions to our websites.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,930
So let's just copy this and where we want to put JavaScript.

31
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,750
And again when we get to that section in this course, we'll talk more about it.

32
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:49,980
We want to put it at the bottom of our 'body' tag and that is because you want these JavaScript files to

33
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:57,750
load after all the content of your websites have loaded. This way we have our website loaded and then

34
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,270
the scripts get downloaded.

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,740
If we put these at the top you'll have to wait for all of them to load before a user can see your website.

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,810
And obviously that's that's not why we want to do. OK.

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,140
And this is all we need to have

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,370
Bootstrap working for us.

39
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,590
So let's play with a few things.

40
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,880
Let's say we wanted to add a navbar.

41
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:25,950
I'll go into the 'Components' and select 'Navbar' and you can read about how it works but I really really

42
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,060
like this navigation bar so I'm just going to copy the code.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,890
And add it to my 'body'. And I know it can get overwhelming when you're copying a whole bunch of code

44
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,450
and you don't know exactly what it's doing.

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,240
But if you actually read this line by line you know everything. It's just a few tags with their own specific

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,510
Bootstrap classes.

47
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,590
So let's save here and refresh. And look at that.

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,660
We have a navigation bar.

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,510
How easy is that.

50
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,630
And one thing that Bootstrap is really famous for and why people love it so much is that it's

51
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,520
 fully responsive so you see the menu bar here.

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:17,100
If I make it bigger that it automatically changes according to what we need.

53
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,460
OK. What else can we add over here.

54
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,850
Let's look at, lets add a 'Jumbotron'.

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,070
'Hello world'.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
I just can copy this.

57
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,440
And again let's add that to - let's add that right below the navbar. So again, in Sublime Text I can minimize this

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:48,900
by clicking the side over here, and below the navbar we'll add this Jumbotron.

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,070
So if I save and refresh look at that. We have 'Hello, world!'.

60
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,980
Let's add one last thing.

61
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,290
We'll do a 'Modal'. And with the modal.

62
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,400
I really like this one.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,630
'Launch demo model' (Live demo model).

64
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,590
So I'm going to copy this (Live demo model).

65
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,470
And again I'm going to minimize the Jumbotron just so we can see what we've added.

66
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,870
Copy and paste this.

67
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,450
Always have to adjust my indentation, perfect. And I save this and refresh.

68
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:30,400
We have the launch demo model and if I click this [Launch demo modal]. Look at that, we have our own modal.

69
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,880
Now. This. Just to prove that this is JavaScript.

70
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,040
If I remove these scripts. I'm just going to comment them out,

71
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,640
and I click this [Launch demo modal].
Nothing happens.

72
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,900
And that's what JavaScript is doing. We'll

73
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,960
get into it like I said, later.

74
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,830
But there are some features that might not work with Bootstrap if you don't include these scripts.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,760
But if you're only using it for styles, then you might not even need these.

76
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:09,710
So if I remove this if you saw we still have all of these. But the navbar isn't working anymore.

77
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,680
So again you can play around and see why you need.

78
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,740
You don't need to know exactly what these scripts do yet, so just leave them there for now.

79
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:26,690
Now how can we change the style so that, you know. We can add our own custom look to our website.

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Well if we wanted to change something like the launch demo model button.

81
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:40,800
Well in that case I can see over here that this is the 'button' and I can look at the classes that

82
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,870
Bootstrap gives us.

83
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:52,600
If I go into Buttons. Well here I can see that all these classes have, all these colors have different names

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,780
so if I want it to be red I can use button 'Danger'.

85
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:06,410
So again I can remove 'btn btn-primary' actually I can just type this out instead of primary.

86
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,510
I can do 'btn btn-danger' save and refresh.

87
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,880
And now the button is red.

88
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,740
But again what if you want your own custom look to the button.

89
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,180
Well that's easy to do.

90
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:28,880
We can now say that from now on I want 'btn btn-danger' to be orange. The way we do that is create a

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,630
stylesheet at the top.

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,990
And now we can add our own stylesheet and you can see it's below the Bootstrap one which means that

93
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:45,000
according to cascading style sheets, our styles will override anything that might match the Bootstrap ones.

94
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,230
So let's create a 'style.css' file here.

95
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,160
And I actually have one created already on our desktop you can see it over here, in the same directory

96
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,320
as the index.html.

97
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:09,030
And here we can say that the '.btn-danger' that we just added has a 'background-color:' of 'orange'.

98
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,000
If I save this and refresh.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,560
Look at that. Our button is now orange and the hover effect is still red and that's the default Bootstrap

100
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,760
so we can do '.btn-danger:hover'

101
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,160
is going to be 'black'. Save and refresh. Look at that.

102
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,500
We have our own custom button.

103
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,240
You can see Bootstrap is very powerful we're able to create websites really really fast this way.

104
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,630
And in the next section we're going to talk about the best feature of Bootstrap that I have yet

105
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,570
 to tell you about.
