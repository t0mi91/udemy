1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,170
Congratulations!

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,580
You're actually learning quite a lot.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,204
Although things might still
seem a little intimidating.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,290
You now have a new found power

5
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:15,074
where you can create websites
you can put them online.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,970
Now there's still lots to learn

7
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:21,994
but one of the neat things about
knowing how much we know now

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,790
is that you can leverage
other people's templates.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,000
Now what does that mean?

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,230
It means that unlike the startup
landing page that we just created

11
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:35,609
you don't have to create
everything from scratch.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,800
As a matter of fact if you
Google free HTML5 templates

13
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:47,849
or free HTML CSS templates there's a ton
of free resources online that you can use.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,439
Now after this lesson I'm going to link
to some of my favorite free resources.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,410
But one of them is "mashup template".

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,830
Here you can actually use a bunch
of free templates for yourself.

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,070
And if I let's say go to "Complex"
here or no let's do "factory"

18
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:11,134
I can actually download
the files here as HTML.

19
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,229
And check this out!

20
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:15,274
If I now open this

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,450
I now have these files and there's a
lot of files that we still don't know.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,470
There's some JavaScript here
that we haven't talked about yet

23
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:25,794
and we'll cover these in later lessons.

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,860
But the thing here is that
you know about HTML and CSS.

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,739
So now if you actually
double click on this HTML

26
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:39,923
you have a website that you can
use and customize to your liking

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,590
and this website is free for you to use.

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,700
You can now change the background image.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,730
You can change what the button does.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,970
You can do different things

31
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:53,634
and you can customize it just like
we have with a startup landing page.

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:01,279
But to your own liking by just changing the
HTML and CSS files which we have right here.

33
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:04,550
This is the power of the web.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,029
The Web allows programmers
to share pieces of code

35
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:13,453
so that we don't have to constantly
reinvent things from scratch.

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,500
Just like Bootstrap allowed
us to do things easily

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,889
in terms of layout, templates allow us to
create websites instead of from scratch

38
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,260
we get to start with a basic template.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,389
Now I want you to try building
your own startup landing page.

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,080
Up until now I've shown you step by step

41
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:38,704
but you have the power to create
something custom to your liking.

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,930
You can use something
like "mashup templates"

43
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,954
or you can elaborate on
the current startup page.

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,520
You have the power to do it.

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,240
And although it may seem a little bit
hard right now we're still starting off.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,380
It's good for you to get that
practice of doing things on your own.

47
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,170
Experimenting on your own.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,869
And even if you fail even if it takes you
hours to just center a text or a button

49
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,230
it's going to be good
practice in the long run.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,950
So give it a go.

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,240
Create your own custom
startup landing page.

52
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,800
And if you're done go share
it in our Discord server.

53
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,140
I'll see you in the next one.

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Bye bye.
