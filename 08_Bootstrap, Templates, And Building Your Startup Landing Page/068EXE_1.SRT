1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,190
Holy moly!

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,230
Good job getting this far in the course.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,660
You should really really
be proud of yourself

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,570
because we've learned a lot.

5
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:11,574
And now we're gonna build
something really exciting.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,240
We're gonna build a startup landing page.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,170
A landing page like this.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,120
That well is responsive

9
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:24,044
but most importantly it has some text.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,100
It has a button.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,500
But check this out.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,270
When you click on the button it takes you to a
form to sign up and collect email addresses.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,920
That's right.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,790
We're building a startup landing page.

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm going to show you
how to do it step by step

16
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:41,244
and you can grab the starter
files attached to this lesson

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,070
because we're gonna build this from scratch

18
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:49,590
and see how we can put something online
that you can now share with your friends.

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,540
Next time you have a big
startup idea. Let's get started.
