1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,560
We've built our beautiful website.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:13,620
We've created a sign up form and it's fully responsive but it's just on our computers.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,360
Let's actually put this online. On the Internet so anybody can access it.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,160
And I'm going to show you one way to do it for free.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,250
Will take a bit of setup.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,060
But this way you'll have a website that is out there and you can showcase it to your friends.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:41,930
So to get started I'm going to suggest that you go to GitHub.com and you're going to create

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,510
an account.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,990
And when we get to the GitHub and Git section we're going to talk more about this.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,640
But GitHub is a platform for developers to showcase their work but also put all their code and make

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,670
sure that it's saved in a location. You can think of it as a resume for developers so. Any developer that

12
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,810
I know has a GitHub account, so create your own as well.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,860
It's completely free and will allow us to put our website online for free.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:18,000
So sign up now and then I'm going to go back to my GitHub where I'm already signed in. And right here

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,750
once you're signed in you'll get to this page and it'll say 'Start a project'.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,590
So I want you to click on 'Start a project' and here this is really important.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:39,770
You need to put the name they you have, your user name of GitHub, first and then put .GitHub.io

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,550
So you have to name your repository. So you can

19
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,800
think of this as project name and then you can click on 'Create repository'.

20
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,120
You'll get this screen and it'll look very very confusing.

21
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,540
Don't worry we don't need to worry about it.

22
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,700
We're gonna have to use the 'Set up in desktop' button. In order to do that we need to download

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,080
GitHub desktop client. So you can easily do that by

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,930
downloading GitHub Desktop. There is for Mac for Windows whichever one you need.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,880
You can download. Once that's downloaded

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,020
let's open it up and you can see here we have

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,590
GitHub Desktop and then to double click to open it.

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,140
You'll get the pop up but you can just open and once you have this you can click on 'Clone a repository'

29
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:35,039
and you will have to sign in to GitHub so this needs to know what your account is on GitHub.com

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,290
So I'm going to click 'sign in' and again this is. you can sign in with your own credentials here

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,350
and there you go.

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:52,200
We should be all signed in. The next step is we're going to click on something called 'Clone a Repository'.

33
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,500
So we're going to click on that and we're going to search for the repository we just created.

34
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,750
So if you remember your username.github.io and because it's signed in to your account it knows

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,750
where to find it.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,590
So from here I'm going to click 'clone'

37
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,200
and it did a whole bunch of magic behind the scenes.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,790
Don't worry about it for now.

39
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:26,000
Now you want to open this repository in Finder. And it's going to open up your folder with your name

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,610
on it and in there I just want you to copy and paste the three files.

41
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,700
You have your index.html your style.css and your header.jpg.

42
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,330
If you have any other files for your website just keep them all in there just a reminder to take it out

43
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,300
of the folder.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,590
There you have it.

45
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,590
I don't want to delete that.

46
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,160
So I'm going to copy that back OK.

47
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:56,450
And once you have that it there, close it. And now you'll see that you have this three files that you've

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,610
just added.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,960
All we need to do now is just write a summary of this. So 'uploading website' and then 'Commit to master'

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,730
you'll need to add a summary in here

51
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,660
otherwise it won't let you click. You click on that and again something happened some magic.

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,510
But if you click on the history tab you'll see that your files are still there. And the final thing you're

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,170
going to do is click this 'Publish branch' button.

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:33,300
If you click on this it's doing a whole bunch of work behind the scenes and it looks like it's done.

55
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,500
Now here's the cool part.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,750
Let's go back to our website and remember this screen.

57
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,430
Now if I refresh

58
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,950
I have my files in there.

59
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,270
So now this location is referencing these files.

60
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,650
And guess what, your website is actually online.

61
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,490
Don't believe me.

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,680
Well let's check up.

63
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,930
All we need to do is go to this link [username.github.io],

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,270
Type it into the bar.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,790
Press enter and there you go.

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,090
We have our website online.

67
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:22,320
So now our beautiful website. Our startup page works and people can sign up for our mailing list.

68
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,830
And check out our startup.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,840
Isn't that cool.

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,820
We're going to be learning more about GitHub and Git later on in the course and there's a special section

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,690
just for it because it's a very important tool.

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,910
But I want you to put your website online so you can show it off to your friends and family and let

73
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,180
them know that you're going to be a pretty good developer.

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,950
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
