1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,880
And welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,120
In the previous video we went over the basic
rules that all HTML files must follow.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,299
And I kind of glossed over this '!DOCTYPE html'
tag, and I did that on purpose because I want

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,590
you to develop a another
developer fundamental concept.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,390
And that is the fact that most of the time, as
developers there's so much information out there that

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,780
there's no way that you can
keep all of that in your head.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,619
And as developers we must get really
really good at problem solving.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,969
So for the doctype let's say if I was working and
somebody gives me this file and I say OK I've got

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,999
this that's good but I'm
not sure what 'doctype' is.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,479
Well again we wanna get really good at Googling here, and
I know it sounds silly, but trust me, as a developer

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,530
you're going to be Googling a lot and going to get really
really good at looking for answers and understanding

12
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,890
meanings behind code.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,710
So, if I go into 'doctype html' and we Google that,
one of the first things that we get is the W3 School

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:17,179
and this is a resource that I highly, highly recommend.
They'll actually explain what the doctype is, and

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,090
even show you a demo of what it does.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,890
You can read into this and get more familiar with it,
but the general rule and the concept behind 'doctype'

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,480
is that 'doctype' says to the browser, 'Hey just
a heads up this file is going to use HTML5.'

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,899
And we'll get into what HTML5, is but right now,
HTML has evolved from back in the day when Tim

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,069
Berners-Lee invented it, to where it is now. And it
has developed and evolved so that it has a few more

20
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,000
tags,

21
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,919
it has a few more features, and this is the way for us
to say, 'Hey, browser we're going to be using HTML5.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,829
So please make sure that you load the website properly.'
And we'll get into what those new tags are and

23
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,160
some of the new syntaxes.

24
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,810
But again most likely in your day to day job you're
going to be writing this at the top because we're

25
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,330
writing in HTML5, if that ever
changes and something new comes along,

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,180
we might change this,
but 'doctype' that's what it is.

27
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,609
But the key concept here is that I really want you
to start Googling, at any time you see in my videos,

28
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,540
something that you don't fully understand
or you want to dig a little bit deeper.

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,489
You really want to grow those roots of your foundation
so that you really understand how the landscape

30
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,120
works.

31
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,520
OK.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,440
So I just wanted to get that concept across that
as a developer, you really want to understand

33
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,920
how things work and what they mean,
and you'll come across in your day to day

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,670
many things that it's very easy to
just, on the surface copy and paste,

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,470
or just look at an example and do it
without fully understanding what it does.

36
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,679
But the developers that get really really good salaries,
really good jobs, and are considered 'senior developers'

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,720
are the ones that fully understand all the
meaning behind the things that they do.

38
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,850
We're going to be taking that throughout the course
and making sure that we develop those fundamentals.

39
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,560
But any time, like I said, you have any questions
or you don't understand something fully,

40
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:24,169
I do encourage you to Google and get the answers
because there's a ton of free resources out there for

41
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,700
you to get fully,
fully comfortable with the topic.

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,210
I'll see you in the next one.
