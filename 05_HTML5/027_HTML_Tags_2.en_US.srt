00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,580
And welcome back. In the previous video we talked
about a few of the common tags that HTML uses.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,709
We're going to expand on that knowledge and learn a few
more. So, I'm going to delete these, and I'm going

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,280
to teach you about something
called an 'Ordered List'.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,020
So an 'ol' tag, and within this
tag we have list 'li' items -

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:39,610
'banana' and, another list item,
'apple', and lastly let's do, 'orange'.

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,139
So if I save this, again, I refresh and we have banana,
apple, orange. So you can see here this is how you

7
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,310
make lists.

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,420
And this is an 'Ordered List' so
you can see we have '1, 2, 3'.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,290
If we want to make it without the numbers, we
use something called an 'Unordered List', 'ul'.

10
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,360
And again I save that,
and refresh, and we have these.

11
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,409
Now there's also subfields
that you can use.

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,690
So again this is all about nesting,
and having parent tags, and children tags.

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,020
So let's say within 'apples' we wanted to have -
let me structure that are a little bit cleaner,

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,949
there you go, within 'apples'.

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:30,100
We also want to emphasize that there is the
'fuji' apple and there is 'honey crisp'.

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,500
And while I can't think of a third type of apple, so,
I'm going to delete that. If I save this, and refresh,

17
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:43,149
well, we have a nested list. There you have it you have
your list items. I'll see in the next video, where

18
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,370
we're going to learn about putting images
into our website and self-closing tags.

19
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,380
See you in the next one.
