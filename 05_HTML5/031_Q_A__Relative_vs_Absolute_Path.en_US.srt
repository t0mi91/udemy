1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,949
And we got another Q&amp;A video for you and this one
is going to be talking about something that you may

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,629
have seen yourself while following along these
videos and that is the fact that this file over here

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,110
is different than let's say if you go to a Web
site and you see 'https'- what does that mean?

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,870
If you go into our example you also saw here that we
have an anchor tag that references a 'newpage.html'

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,670
that has nothing like 'file'
or 'http' in front of it.

6
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,410
And then you also saw that the images here are referencing
some sort of a website that links to a picture.

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:53,899
So what's the difference here? The difference here is
that the first is using the file protocol and that

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,140
means that this web-page -

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,830
I can't really access it
outside of my computer.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,039
This is using something
called a relative path.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:15,059
If I go into my 'index.html' I am saying
to link to 'newpage.html' relative to where

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,979
'index.html' is.

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,590
So if we go to our desktop
you see that 'index.html'

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,730
lives in the same directory,
which is the desktop, as 'newpage.html'.

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:35,990
So I can reference it through here. If I created a new
folder or let's say, "test" I would have to reference

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
it this way.

17
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,620
So let's let's check here.

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,900
If I save this and go into the web-page refresh and
click "New Page" I'll get "Your file was not found."

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:59,830
But now if I go into my desktop and create "test"
and I put the new page in here and let's bring back

20
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,670
everything refresh and click on new page,

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,800
this is now working.

22
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,230
And you can see over here that I'm accessing
it through "Desktop/test/newpage.html".

23
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,039
So that's called a relative path.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,370
So relative to where 'index.html'
page is I am saying, " 'index.html',

25
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,440
I want to access from
'test/newpage.html' ".

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,269
If you look at the images you'll see
that we have something different.

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,689
We're accessing the image through http, which
we'll get into into later videos when we talk about

28
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,460
servers but this is how we
access files over the internet.

29
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,800
If I wanted this anchor tag, this 'New Page' to actually
link to something, maybe another website, maybe

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:56,810
to this hilarious gif. Well I can copy this link,
open up my Sublime Text, and now I can just copy this

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,600
with the https protocol.

32
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,790
And now this is an absolute link.
No matter where I reference this -

33
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:15,409
if I put it into 'newpage.html', or 'index.html',
no matter what, this link will get me to this

34
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,760
gif.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,819
So let's test that out:

36
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,220
I save this, I refresh, and I click
on 'New Page', and look at that.

37
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,960
We have the gif.

38
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,730
Hopefully that answers your question.

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,139
We'll get into http,
and https later on in the course.

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:41,259
But for now keep that in mind, that there is absolute
path and then there is relative path - going to fix that,

41
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,140
so we have it back for the next video.

42
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,610
I'll see on the next one.

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,090
Bye-bye
