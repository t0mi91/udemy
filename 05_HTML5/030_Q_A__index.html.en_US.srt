And welcome to the student Q&amp;A
section as students take this course,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,150
usually I get a bunch of questions. Some of them
are really really good, some of them I get often.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,559
And we're going to use these Q&amp;A sections for me to
make a reply video to answer some of those really

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
really good questions.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,620
And the first thing we're going to
tackle for this video is 'index.html'.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:33,919
If we go back to our example that we had, you
noticed that I've always used 'index.html' as

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,850
the first page.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,100
And then we created 'newpage.html'.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,989
Now you might be asking
yourself why 'index.html'.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,940
Why not 'home.html', or 'apples.html'?
And you could actually do that.

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,139
But I can explain this really
well by looking at this diagram.

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,760
Most of the time there are
more than a few html files.

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,470
You saw that with our example we had our
'index.html' and also 'newpage.html'.

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:11,389
But when we make that request to let's say google.com,
how does the server know which html (file) to

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,780
return first for the homepage?

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,350
And you could go into the server and configure it
and tell it you know what I want 'about.html' to

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:28,969
be the first page. But, by default most servers just
say, "I'll return 'index.html'- if I see 'index.html'

18
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,300
in the servers, I'll just return that."

19
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,489
So this is just a common practice that you'll see
in a lot of the projects that a lot of the websites

20
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,390
that you'll work with,

21
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:43,480
is that 'index.html' is usually, you can think
of it as the home-page, the first a HTML file

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,350
that the server returns.

23
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:53,769
And if anybody in the 'index.html' clicks on that
link, then it will return whichever link they return.

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,850
So there will be - let's say they click on 'About'
anchor tag, then they'll get 'about.html'.

25
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,860
So that's it.

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,320
That is your answer to your question.

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,870
I'll see in the next one. Bye-bye
