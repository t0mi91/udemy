1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,670
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:08,149
In this video we're going to expand on our knowledge
and introduce you to a few more HTML tags and

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,270
make this website look a little bit
prettier than just, "Hellooooooooo there."

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,070
To get started I'm just going to move
the screens around so you can see better.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:16,850
All right.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,220
So we have left, and right, and again
just to make sure everything works.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:33,489
If I change anything here to, - and then I click
'Save', and then I refresh the page, I have everything

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,140
updating perfect. Now,

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,389
these aren't the only HTML
tags that you'll encounter.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:49,929
There is actually a ton of them, and if you go back
to the 'w3schools.com' you'll see over here all

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,580
the HTML tags that exist.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,790
There's a lot of them.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,530
We're only going to be going through,

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,099
I would say maybe, 10 or 15 or so because those are
the only ones that, well technically, that I've used

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,779
in many years of devolvement - there's a few
things on here that I've never even heard of.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,830
I've never used.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,870
You can always look up
and learn them yourself.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,079
But I'll say that there's about
10 or 15 tags that are used,

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,989
ninety-nine percent of the time and
those are the ones that you'll encounter.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,890
So we'll go through some of those most popular ones
and HTML doesn't really get any harder than -

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,100
than this.

22
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:38,840
This is the syntax, as long as you get used to these
little signs and structure you're pretty much a

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,230
HTML developer.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,310
So the first tag that I want to
introduce you to is the 'h1' tag.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,690
So the way that I have it
here is actually not right.

26
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:57,339
You want to make sure that everything is surrounded by
a tag, so a web browser right now can see 'BOOOOO',

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,860
and just print out 'BOOOOO'.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,300
But if you want to do it right,
you'd want to put something like an 'H1'

29
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,960
And an 'h1' tag.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,130
If I saved this and I refresh,
we get what we call a 'header'.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,029
So that is a header and then
one what '1' does one mean?

32
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,690
Well it actually goes all the way up to 6.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,840
So if I change this to '2', and I'm not going to do
every single one, let's just do another one 'h6'

34
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:42,130
and if I save this, and refresh the page, you can
see that there's different sizes in the text.

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,570
So that's the header tag.

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:53,030
And again if I scroll through the W3 Schools and I go
to the 'h' you see over here that there's the header

37
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,680
tags explained here.

38
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,789
And this website is really really cool because you
can actually click on 'Try it Yourself', and you can

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,830
play around with different things.

40
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,300
Click run, and it changes it for you.

41
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,650
So again, this is a really really good website
for you to get familiar with all the tags.

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,929
But, again we're going to
stick to our website for now.

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,739
Another thing that I want to introduce you to is something
called a 'p' tag, or a paragraph tag. A paragraph

44
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,560
tag lets you have paragraphs.

45
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,809
So now if I refresh, well there's not much different
from what we had before, which was no tags and just

46
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:49,360
saving it, refresh but you can see the difference
when I copy and paste this and have a few paragraphs

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,260
versus this.

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,270
Let's see what happens.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,760
I save this.

50
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,620
You'll see over here that with Sublime Text it after
I don't know what to say about maybe like 20 saves

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,929
it'll ask you to make a purchase, because technically
this is a non-registered one. You can ignore for now,

52
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,130
just click 'Cancel'.

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,720
Again it's just one annoying thing
that will pop up every now and then.

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,660
I actually have a registered Sublime Text,
I just wanted to show you this error,

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,100
so you're not surprised when you see it.

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,819
You can use Sublime Text for as
long as you need it, for free.

57
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,009
When you start getting into the developer role and
working full time with it, I do recommend that you make

58
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,460
a purchase.

59
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,050
It's a great program and -

60
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,629
and you still get everything
through the 'I'm registered'.

61
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,460
You just have this pop up that
shows up after a few saves.

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,099
But anyways, from now on I'm going to
be using a registered Sublime account.

63
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,150
I just wanted to show you that error.
If I refresh the page here,

64
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,760
you'll see that I have the
paragraphs show up nicely.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,250
But these unstructured pieces of text,
well, everything is kind of in one line.

66
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,139
And HTML doesn't really know what to do with
it, so it puts everything all on one line.

67
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,899
I also want to show you one other quick trick in
Sublime Text, so writing this jibberish is not very

68
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,910
exciting and kind of takes a bit of time.

69
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,299
Developers are lazy.

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,350
We want to make sure that everything
is done fast and efficient.

71
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,920
So if you actually put 'Lorem' here and then
press 'Tab' you'll get Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,190
So let's do that and delete that.
'Lorem', 'Tab'.

73
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,700
And then one more, 'Lorem', 'Tab'. Perfect.

74
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,709
Let's save that and, 'Refresh',
and we have nice paragraphs.

75
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:39,429
As you can see we have some tags, and what we call
'nested tags', so you can see that the 'body' is the

76
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,379
parent and Sublime Text actually
lets you close and open these.

77
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,690
So you have the 'body' tag, you have the header ('h1',
etc.) tags, which are children of the 'body' tag.

78
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
And then we have 'p' tags.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,140
A lot of people get confused in the naming.

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,670
I've mentioned these as tags, so essentially
anything that has this syntax is a tag.

81
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:11,009
But this is called an 'h1 element' so that's when it's
an entire block of functionality with content inside

82
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,330
it.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,379
So again tags.

84
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,730
And then this is an 'h1 element'.

85
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,519
Again it's just naming but you'll hear tags and
elements kind of used interchangeably but those are

86
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,900
the specific differences.

87
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,740
All right let's get into some of the more exciting
things, let's say for example I really want to emphasize

88
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,930
'Lorem ipsum' here.

89
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:45,479
Well I can use another tag, a 'b' tag, and then we close
it at 'Lorem ipsum'. Let's make that screen here a little

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,960
bit bigger.

91
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,370
Just so you can see.

92
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,840
There you go.

93
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,280
So we have the 'b' tags over here.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,690
And if I click 'Save', I refresh.

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,830
- Oops, we don't want
to translate this page.

96
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,379
We see that this is now bolded.
Again, let's make it a little bit bigger.

97
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,000
There you go.

98
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:10,389
Now this syntax is actually not used anymore, or is not
recommended - obviously still works, but there was

99
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:20,019
a problem that - HTML was initially used for websites that
ran on computers, on PCs, on Macs. And now we have things

100
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,710
such as mobile phones and iPads, although the bold
text, and we actually have another one which was

101
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:39,530
the italicised, 'i', although we had this, for most
phones - some of them didn't have the ability to bold

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,840
the text, and didn't have the ability
to italicise, or some screen readers,

103
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,329
which people who are visually impaired use, didn't
really understand the meaning behind italicised

104
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,030
and bold.

105
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:59,349
So now we use something called,
'strong' for bold and 'Refresh'.

106
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:06,570
And then for italicized we
use, 'em' for emphasis.

107
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,530
And there you go.

108
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:16,619
Now, the reason this change was made was a move
towards more - something called semantic HTML, and

109
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,189
we'll get into that into a later lesson but just
know that there are some tags that have evolved over

110
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,359
the years and it's part
of why HTML5 exists.

111
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,700
We'll get into that a little bit more,

112
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,480
but just wanted to give
you a quick note on that.

113
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,330
All right.

114
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:33,619
I think that's enough for now.

115
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,039
We're going to get into more
tags in the next video. For now,

116
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,840
play around and I'll
see you in the next one.
