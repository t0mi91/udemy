00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,799
And welcome back! In the previous videos we
talked about some of the most common a HTML tags

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,530
and how the HTML document
is read by the browser.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,449
However we've missed one critical feature of HTML,
and if we go back to our diagram here, that we

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:29,809
should remember from the first section the HTML
file gets sent to us but the power of HTML is

5
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,689
in its ability to link to other document.

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:40,970
So if I go back here to our website it's a simple one
page website but I can't really click on 'fuji',

7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,490
or 'apple', or 'banana'.

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,799
It doesn't link to anything.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,070
There must be a HTML tag that
we can use for that right?

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,700
Well yes there is.

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,200
It's called a anchor tag.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,440
So an anchor tag is very easy just an 'a'.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:06,100
And this anchor tag has something called an 'href' which
is an attribute and it's the hypertext reference.

14
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,289
So in this 'href' you'll be
able to link to something.

15
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,360
Let's close this 'a' tag.

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,560
An 'a' tag has an opening and closing tag.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,679
And if I save this and refresh the page, well nothing
happens because you need something in the anchor

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,140
tag.

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,540
So let's do "New Page".

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,690
I save that, I refresh.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,809
And we have "New Page" here.

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:40,510
Now if I click this, nothing happens. But you can see
that it has the link, and the mouse changes images,

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,329
so it's clickable but nothing happens.

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,600
Well that's because we need to
specify where we want the link to go.

25
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,610
Now let's think about this if
we want to link to a new page.

26
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,020
We don't really have another new
page, if you remember

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,330
We only have 'index.html'.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,200
Wouldn't it be great if there was
another file that we can link to?

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,520
Well let's create another file.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,030
So let's open up Sublime Text,

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:14,680
actually. I'm going to say 'File' 'New
File', I'm going to save this as 'newpage'

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,180
And we're going to save it to
desktop and see over here how,

33
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,809
when I went to Sublime Text,

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,120
It's now a 'Plain Text'?

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:31,670
I need to make sure that this is an HTML file, so I
can just do 'newpage.html'. Save, and Sublime Text

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,159
automatically adjusts to the 'HTML'.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,310
So again I can type in that short command, 'html' and (then
press) 'Tab', that comes with Sublime Text, and let's do

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,730
the title 'New Page' and the 'body'

39
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,930
We can just do a header [h1] that
says, "This is the new page!"

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,290
If I save this... great! we have a new page. And if I go
to my desktop here, you see that I have 'newpage.html'

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,200
and 'index.html'.

42
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,270
So how do we link these two together?

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,129
Well it's very simple.

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,380
We open up sublime again
and within 'index.html'.

45
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:22,770
The 'href' can now say we're linking to 'newpage.html'.
Let's save that and let's give it a try.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,320
Refresh the page, click,

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,020
And "This is a new page!" awesome.

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,580
But to go back we have to press the back symbol,
so let's link back to the original file again.

49
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:46,160
We can do this by 'p' tag, which is for 'paragraph'
- I'm going to say 'Go Back'. Close that tag [/p].

50
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,800
But, hold on a minute.

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,930
I need an anchor tag, right?

52
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,169
If I just save this, and refresh the
page, I say, 'Go Back'.

53
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:02,240
But what if you really, really want this to be a
paragraph, or let's say you want this to be an 'h2' but

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,340
you also want it to be an anchor tag.

55
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,670
Well that's very simple you just
wrap it in an anchor tag [a].

56
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,480
And just so it's nice and clear,
we're going to have the nice spacing here.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,640
And again an anchor tag must have an 'href', which tells
us where to go. And we want to go to 'index.html'

58
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,460
So, 'index.html', save, and refresh.

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,870
Let's go back.

60
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,110
Let's go to the next one, and back.

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,850
So this is the power that comes with
HTML, this ability to link to other pages.

62
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,969
And yeah, we can have text, we can have lists, we can
have images, but the true power is in this linking

63
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,040
ability. In the next episode
we're going to expand on this.

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,410
I'll see you in that one. Bye-bye
