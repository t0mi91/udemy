00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,780
Hello and welcome back to
a very exciting section.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,680
Why is it exciting?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,370
Well, we finally get to code, and we're going to start
off by learning HTML, and then finally building

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,140
our very first website.
In order for us to get started,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,919
we need to set up our
environment, and we do that by -

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,070
let's open up Google Chrome and we're
going to search for 'Sublime Text 3'.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,140
This is a text editor that
a lot of developers use.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,270
I myself have used it for years.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,650
I absolutely love it.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,530
In your day to day job you'll
use something like this.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,500
I highly recommend Sublime Text.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:47,310
If you have a Mac version over here if you have a PC
running Windows, you'll have the download link for

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,290
Windows.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:56,339
So for me I'm going to download for the Mac and you
can see here it's downloaded and I can drag it to

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,909
my applications folder if I want and you can double click.
And if this is your first time downloading Sublime

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,860
Text, you get something like this
to give it permission to load.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,040
And there you go, we have Sublime Text.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:19,990
Now what is a text editor? A text editor is a program that allows us to write code.

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,300
You can see over here on the right hand side of Sublime Text that it just says 'Plain Text' so I can

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:34,910
type anything that I want and there's nothing much different than if you wrote this in Word or a text

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,160
file. But the part with a text editor, especially with something like Sublime, that's geared towards coding.

22
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:48,800
If you click on 'Plain Text' here, you'll have a whole bunch of options of what type of code you're writing.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,550
So in our case we're doing HTML,

24
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,970
so if I click on 'HTML', nothing changes except for the bottom part over here.

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:06,580
But now if I type something, well everything looks the same, but if I start typing HTML, It'll

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,530
actually recognize it and help with syntax.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:17,280
So here now if I write HTML, look at that you get a nice little color completion.

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,730
So for us, for now, we're going to be writing HTML, you can see over here that there's different options

29
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,350
there is - where is it...

30
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,190
There's CSS, Javascript - which we'll learn later, so we're going to be using Sublime Text for this. For

31
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,390
now,

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,870
click on HTML, and let's write our very first web-page. In order for us to have a web page,

33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,400
we write 'HTML' which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,650
So bear with me here,

35
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,120
This is going to be new.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,860
But keep in mind that this is exactly what every single HTML page has.

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,540
These are the set of rules that all HTML files must follow.

38
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,130
And it goes like this.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,100
We define a doctype, and don't worry I'll get into what that means in the next video

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,000
Then we have 'html' and we close the tags: '/html'

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,930
The second part, we have a 'head' and a closing '/head'.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,090
You can see over here, some patterns forming.

43
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:28,380
Don't worry, I'll get back to these tags and explaining what they do, in a bit. And then we also have a 'body'

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,840
and then closing tags, '/body'.

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:44,540
And finally here in the 'head' we have something called a 'title', that so this over here, is the rule that

46
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:50,250
every single HTML file must follow. So, just looking at this right now, without knowing any HTML,

47
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,730
you can get an idea of what everything means.

48
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,230
So 'html', we're defining that this is an HTML.

49
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,230
We're saying that this is the 'head' of the HTML, with the title, and we're saying that this is the

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,500
'body' of the HTML.

51
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,130
So let's try something here.

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:17,310
Let's save this file, and we're going to save it - let's do 'Desktop', and we're going to call it,

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,940
'index.html' - you can see that it's already completed the ‘html’ syntax for us. Save and we have

54
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,840
an index.html

55
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,070
file here.

56
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,660
Let's drag this all the way down to our Google Chrome and open it up and, well, nothing happens.

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,890
But, lets, add a bit of text to it.

58
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,990
So in the title, I'm going to say, "My first website!".

59
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,840
And then in the body I'm just going to put "Hellooooooooo there.".

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,840
OK.

61
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,100
So if I save this,

62
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,950
and just to show you, from now on I'm going to be doing 'CMD-S' to save, just to go faster.

63
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:12,030
And now if I refresh this page I have, "Hellooooooooo there." and you can see the power over here, of what we just

64
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,790
did.

65
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:23,620
We have "Hellooooooooo there." as the text, which is in the body, and then we also have "My first website!" as the

66
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,300
title.

67
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,190
And you can see over here in the file, that we're referencing 'index.html' on my Desktop.

68
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,470
You can see here that we have 'html'.

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,660
We have the 'head', which we haven't really talked about yet but, we see that the title is in the head, kind

70
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,090
of like a header. And then we have the body which, by looking at this, we can assume that it's whatever

71
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,880
shows up onto the web page. Before we expand on this and make it, a little bit prettier,

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,970
because now it's just simple text.

73
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,340
I want to reiterate the fact that what we've just done is very similar to what a server does.

74
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:07,840
If we go back to our mock ups here, you remember that when we entered 'google.com' the servers send us

75
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:15,160
an HTML file, that when we moved the 'index.html' file all the way down to Google Chrome, that's

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,880
what we just did.

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:25,030
We mimicked a server and we gave it to the browser to load up the HTML file and because browsers are

78
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:32,420
built to know what HTML files are, it can read the syntax and say OK this is HTML.

79
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:32,980
OK.

80
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,070
You want my 'title' to be' "My first website!", and you want my 'body' to say "Hellooooooooo there."

81
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,060
That's perfect.

82
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,490
These are the default HTML rules.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,270
That you'll see all the time.

84
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,500
It is a little bit confusing at first but this is it.

85
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,000
You just have to remember that there is a tag.

86
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:03,910
So, an 'html’ tag, a 'head' tag, a 'title' tag, a 'body' tag, and these tags usually have an opening and closing.

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,570
There's some exceptions to this rule, and we'll get into that a little bit later on in the videos.

88
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,410
But just remember this for now.

89
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,730
So I wanted to try creating your very first web site and seeing how it works, and once you're done with

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,030
that

91
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,610
I want to show you that Sublime Text actually has a nice shortcut so you don't have to keep writing

92
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,080
those tags over and over.

93
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,920
So, the way you do that is you type in, 'html' now, and then press the 'Tab' key and it loads all this up for

94
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,150
you.

95
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,620
OK, so now that we've done this, I want you to go off and create your very first website.

96
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,900
Now, I know it's very, very simple.

97
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,150
You can put whatever you want in the title and you can put whatever you want

98
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,790
in the body. And in the next video we're going to start expanding on our first website.

99
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,690
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
