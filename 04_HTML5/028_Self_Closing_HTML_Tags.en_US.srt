1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,240
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,029
In this video we're going to be
learning about self-closing tags.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:14,339
Up until this point we use all tags that have the
opening and then the closing which has this slash

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,419
in it.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,139
Now there are a few elements that don't have this
syntax but they have something called 'self-closing

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,800
tags'.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,579
So let's say here between Fuji and Honeycrisp
I want to have a bit of a line break.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,430
I can use something like 'br' here
and if I save this and I 'refresh',

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,680
we have a little line break.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,740
There's also 'hr' which is horizontal line,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,730
so you get a horizontal line
for refresh right through here.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,460
'hr' tags just have one single
element, self-closing.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:00,579
You might also see something like this, and that
is something from the old version of HTML, which

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,420
uses xHTML.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,319
You can read up more about it on your own, but just
keep in mind that with HTML5, we are just going

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,200
to be using this.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,759
So obviously on web pages
there's going to be images.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,250
So would it be nice if there was
a picture of a Fuji apple here.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,330
Let's see how we can do it.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,829
So with an image tag, and let's think about this
critically if I didn't know what an image tag is and

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:33,119
I wanted to add an image to my HTML file, well
if I Google "image HTML tag", again one of the

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:42,750
first websites that pops up is the W3 Schools, and
I'll show you exactly how an image tag works.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,009
If I click try yourself you can see it in action
you can play around with but you can see here that

24
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,029
an image tag is a self-closing tag.

25
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,130
There's no closing image tags
just just one single tag.

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:05,050
And if I do image [img] and we have something called
source here and this is something called an attribute

27
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,709
some HTML tags can have something called attributes,
which add special properties to the specific

28
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,410
tag.

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,949
So an attribute always has a value attached
to it and the image source [img src].

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,089
That's what it stands for,
tells us where the image is coming from.

31
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:36,770
So let's find an image of fuji apple let's go, images, oh, I
like this one. Let's do 'view image' and give us the link

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,109
of where this image is.

33
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,770
So I'm just going to copy
that paste it in here.

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,729
Let's go back to our example here we can see here
that there's a few more attributes that we can add

35
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,860
to an image tag.

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,510
But for now we can just
leave it here close the tag.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:05,250
You can see that Sublime Text has the nice highlighting
for us and if I save this go back to our website

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,700
and I click refresh I get this massive fuji
apple, and obviously that's that's too big.

39
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,279
Ideally we can make it a little bit smaller again
if we go back to the example you'll see that there

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:29,780
has width and height so we can actually just copy
that and add it to the attributes so that we specify

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,420
the width.

42
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,420
And this is in pixels [px].

43
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,160
So I save that, I refresh and look at that we
have the fuji apple, it looks very very pretty.

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's add the picture
for honeycrisp as well.

45
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm going to do this fast.

46
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,410
You should be able to just copy this image.

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,760
And again we want to make it the same size as the
previous one so I'm going to leave the width and height

48
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,450
the same.

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,599
And let's find a - an image
of a honeycrisp apple.

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:07,040
So, 'honeycrisp apple' and 'Images',
it looks quite similar doesn't it?

51
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:16,400
And 'view image' let's copy the
source from here going to save that.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,080
Go back to our website and
let's refresh and look at that.

53
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,499
We have our apples.
So, image tags are very very useful.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,940
You might be asking yourself,
"what does the 'alt' attribute mean?"

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,189
And this is something that you can actually read up
on so if you scroll down if you look over here you

56
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,019
can see that 'alt' specifies
an alternate text for an image.

57
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,589
So again, this is something that can be used by screen
readers and you can define what the image is of.

58
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,960
So, here the 'alt' is "smiley face".

59
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:57,249
So when a screen reader reads it, it says, "Oh and
this part of the website there is a smiley face".

60
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,000
Just to recap, we learned about
self-closing tags - which don't require

61
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,530
two of them, so an opening and closing tag.

62
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,720
Just a single one.

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,269
So we use 'br' for line break.

64
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:18,580
We used 'hr' for a horizontal line, and then we have
the image tag that also has to have some attributes.

65
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,100
So, it has a source which tells
us where to grab the image from,

66
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:30,219
it has a width attribute, a height attribute,
with a value of 42 pixels, and 42.

67
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,790
All right I'll see you in the next lesson.
