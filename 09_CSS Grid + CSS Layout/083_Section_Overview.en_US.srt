00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,970
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:05,273
In this section I want to
tackle the problem that we have

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,969
especially when we're starting out

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,309
that is "How do I create
a layout of a website?".

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,450
And it's probably the hardest thing
to learn when you're starting off.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,210
How do you create something let's
say like this that is responsive that

7
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,734
we see all across the web.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,490
A navigation bar, a header,
some grids, a footer down here.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,610
And how do we really make it responsive?

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,820
In this section we're going to
build an ideal webpage layout.

11
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:47,244
So that moving forward you
have the baseline and fondation

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,959
to go off and customize and build whatever
sites you want that are responsive without

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,740
spending a lot of time trial and error trying
different things with CSS hoping that it works.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,740
So I'm going to show you my
recommended way of laying out web pages

15
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:07,640
that is responsive and have that
template available to you moving forward.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,730
We're also going to learn about a
new feature in CSS called CSS grid

17
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:16,254
which is a really really powerful.

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:23,150
And as you learn allows us to use
this CSS grid combined with flexbox

19
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:27,074
to honestly not even need
things like Bootstrap 4

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,170
or other libraries that
allow you to do grids.

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,130
Back in the day, it was really
really hard to do layout and in CSS.

22
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:39,954
But with tools like CSS
grid and flexbox you now

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,230
have the ability to really build beautiful
responsive layouts really really fast.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,819
So let's get started.

25
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,230
See you in the next video.
