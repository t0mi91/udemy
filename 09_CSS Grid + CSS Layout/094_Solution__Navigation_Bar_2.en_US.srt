00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,740
Wellcome back! In the last video we had this problem of
the view getting a little bit ugly with our navigation

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,630
as we became smaller and
smaller with our viewport.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,100
How can we fix this?

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:20,029
And here I'm going to show you a topic that actually
cover in my next course but just because it might

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:27,550
be useful for this case I'm going to introduce you
to something called media queries and media queries

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:34,989
allow us to create responsive websites and tell our
web pages what to do when the size of our screen

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,020
gets small or big.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,870
And I'll link to this website over here.

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:48,099
But essentially what it allows us to do with media
queries we can have devices tablets laptops wearables

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,920
that have different screen sizes and tell it how
to display our web page based on those sizes.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,040
For example here it shows us what our viewports
will be for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S and using this

12
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:13,330
syntax of @ media only screen and giving it
some min-device-width and max-device-width.

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:22,359
We can tell it how to display our page or have CSS
properties specific to just this view size that

14
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,360
is minimum view size is going to
be 320 pixel and max is 480 pixels.

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,530
And as you can imagine there is a lot of these
based on different devices and viewports.

16
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,959
Now things like CSS grid and flexbox actually resolve
a lot of this but I want to demonstrate just

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:50,670
one use case with our little example
that is this contacts getting smushed.

18
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,480
So let's create our own media query
for our navigation. In order to do that

19
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,690
all we need to do is say '@media' we say 'only
screen' and this is saying what do we want our media

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,600
query for.

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,109
And you can do things like print here for example
when you're printing something but 99 percent of the

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,070
time you're just going to have screen.

23
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:25,420
And here we're going to say 'and' we'll say that
'max-width' is going to be 600px that is use this

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:34,239
CSS properties that we're about to define right
here only when max-width its 600px that is as soon

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,880
as this is less than 600px

26
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:46,850
in witdh, apply these properties here so
I'll say main-nav will have a font-size.

27
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,979
We can do different things here but let's just say
a smaller font size and maybe will do padding of

28
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,800
zero just so they're closer together.

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,790
If I save this and refresh.

30
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,860
Look at that!

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,399
Everything fits in because our font size is smaller
and we've removed any extra padding that we may

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
have.

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:17,509
But notice here as I make things bigger you see
that as soon as I pass 600px we restore our

34
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,450
defaults with larger font size.
Look at that!

35
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,810
So using media queries we just
made our navbar more responsive.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,410
Nice and easy.

37
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:40,690
And this is a common pattern that I recommend with
your navigation that is having our nav element with

38
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,660
an unordered list and an li list.

39
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:52,879
Our main-nav which will be a flexbox and we'll
have a push class that uses this margin left

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,390
auto

41
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,640
to push whatever we want to
our nav to the right side.

42
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,760
Usually something like contact or log-in
to have it all the way to the right.

43
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,900
So hopefully this wasn't too bad.

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,690
Like I said you don't
need to memorize this.

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,609
You can even copy the code that I'll leave for you
at the end of these videos once you get used to this

46
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,619
syntax you now have a solid
foundation to build the navigation.

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,010
But we have three more things to go so
let's get to that in the next video.
