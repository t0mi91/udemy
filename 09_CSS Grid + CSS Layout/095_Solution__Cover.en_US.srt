00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,470
Now that we have our navigation
let's focus on our cover.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,690
If we go back to our HTML page we have our cover div
here and we can just keep the div here as it is

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,810
because we don't really know what the cover will be
just yet but I want to add a new CSS class called

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,990
container here.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,159
And this container is going to define some properties
for us that will make this truly a cover image

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,420
just like we have in our
solution web page over here.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,790
And let's add those exclamation marks because
we're excited not for contacts for the cover.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,360
Let's add the exclamation marks over here.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
Nice.

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,480
All right.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:55,910
We'll go to our style.css and
we'll add on our cover style now.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,030
This is actually going to be fairly easy.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:10,019
We want to have let's say display of flex or first
of all let's make sure that we have the container

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,809
class and we'll have a display of flex and I'm not
using grid here because well we're not going to have

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,509
any grid items we won't have that many items in a
cover it's usually a button or a background image

17
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,370
or some text and display flex
just makes things nice and simple.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,379
And usually we want things in the cover to be centered
that is we want this cover to be right in the

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,000
center.

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,870
And as we make things smaller it's
always going to be in the center.

21
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,280
That's something that we see
a lot of in a lot of websites.

22
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,219
And to do that especially
with Flexbox is really easy.

23
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:57,990
All we need to say is to align-items center
and to justify-content center just like that.

24
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,280
If I save here and refresh.
All right this is centered.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,249
And as I move things perfect everything is absolutely
centered but obviously cover image should be a

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,899
little bit larger, right?

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,980
What do we do here?

28
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,899
And I want to introduce to you something that
you haven't seen before but don't get scared.

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
It's not that hard.

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,779
I'm going to have height and just to start us off I'm
going to show you usually you might do something

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,620
like 500px and if I refresh.

32
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,240
Awesome.

33
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,860
I have a nice little height but
there's a problem here, right?

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:45,079
Because I'm saying 500px here if the viewport if
I move things around if I lift things up you'll

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,910
see that all right the view is not responsive
when I go up because it's always 500px.

36
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,649
And this might not be the worst idea ever.

37
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,600
Maybe you want your
website to be like that.

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,969
But if you do want this to be responsive in terms
of going up and down as well what we can do is use

39
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:16,969
something called the 'vh' that is the viewport height
and I like using viewport height a new unit that

40
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,270
we haven't seen before for making things
responsive when it comes to height.

41
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:29,569
And what this states it's going to look at the viewport
that is the view of the web page and make sure

42
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,690
that there's always a percentage of that
viewport dedicated to this container.

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:47,719
So if I do 50vh and if I refresh here you'll see
that my cover will be 50 percent of our viewport.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,360
If I do 100 and I refresh

45
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,810
you see that the cover fills
up the entire viewport.

46
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:09,269
The cool part is if I go up and down this adjusts
exactly according to the viewport height that is the

47
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,560
window of the browser.

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Very cool right.

49
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,040
And everything is still centered.

50
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,560
So I like using the vh for
something like a container.

51
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,820
So let's keep it at 50 and if I refresh
look at that nice and responsive.

52
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,910
How cool is that!

53
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,140
And that's it for the cover.

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Not that hard, right?

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,400
Let's move on to the project
grid in the next video. Bye bye.
