00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:09,120
Another thing I want to show you with the individual
item in a grid is that we can do something like

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,510
justify-self.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:20,499
Remember up here we did justify-items and align-items
but when it comes to individual items we have to

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,710
use self.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:30,920
And as you can imagine if I do self start and I
refresh your we go to the start of the column.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:43,370
If I do align it's going to go to the start of the
row and if we do end and refresh again we see that

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,250
the same thing is happening.

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm going to leave this file for you
as well so you can play around with it.

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:58,089
I encourage you to try to create different types of
grids and looks that you want as you can see it's

10
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:05,829
pretty powerful but also very very simple and allows
us to create responsive grid systems very very

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,119
easily.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,039
Now there's actually a cheat sheet that you can use
to summarize everything that I've taught you up

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,550
until now there's a link to this video.

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,860
It's called the, well,
the grid cheat sheet.

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,850
And it shows you exactly why you
need to do for the container.

16
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:32,369
We've learned about grid-gap grid-templates align-items
and also what to do with the children such as

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:39,870
grid-column, justify-self, align-self and it has all
these little snippets that you can just click on and

18
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,650
copy.

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,660
So I recommend you play around with
some of these properties on your own.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,100
Because in the next part we're going to use
CSS grid to build a complete website layout.

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,940
I'll see in that one. Bye bye.
