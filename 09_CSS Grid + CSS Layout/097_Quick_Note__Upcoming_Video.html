In the next video, I introduce you to a website noshoott.xyz that gives you free&nbsp;Design resources. Unfortunately the website has become inactive, so instead, I have compiled a list of all of my favourite free resources/assets/images and logo makers for you which is even better. You can access these in the <strong>RESOURCES</strong> attached to the video lesson coming up. Enjoy them :)</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
