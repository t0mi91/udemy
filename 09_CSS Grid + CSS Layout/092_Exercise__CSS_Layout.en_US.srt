00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:10,090
Welcome back. Now up to this point we learned about
HTML, CSS, templates and learned how to do layout

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,429
with things like flexbox and CSS grid and probably
the most important thing that you need to know

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:23,239
from these sections is how to create a website right
how to layout a website but also not spend a lot

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,859
of time on simple tasks because when we get to the
JavaScript section which is the more exciting actual

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,120
logic programming part of the course
that's when you truly become a developer.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,390
Up until now with what we've learned is the foundation
that that allows us to build web apps and applications

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:48,820
but you're never going to actually get
interviewed about these specific topics.

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:55,390
I mean yes in small cases you might be if you're a
designer you might get asked questions about CSS

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,040
and HTML.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:03,109
But most of the time the questions you'll be asked
is on things like JavaScript logic and more complex

11
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,490
topics that we're going to
cover later on in the course.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,320
But the one thing that I really want to take away
from this section is being able to build websites

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,709
fast or at least get to the part where you need to
start writing javascript because that's where your

14
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,239
real job begins.

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,729
So I have a task for you using all
the skills that you've learned.

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,999
Up until now I wanted to do create a layout of a
website something that you're going to do over and

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
over throughout your career.

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:41,330
And I've created a small starter file here where we
have these little button like containers or divs.

19
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:49,449
But as the name suggests I want you to align these
in a responsive way to something that looks like

20
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,100
this.

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,269
I know it's not the prettiest thing right now to
look at and we're only focusing on layout but what

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,720
I want you to do is to make the header
green button over here be an actual header.

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,389
We want the cover to be well the actual cover of our
site and then maybe have a project grid where we

24
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:17,779
list all of our projects like we have over here and
then obviously a footer at the bottom and I've selected

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,159
this layout because it's a very common pattern that
you'll see in a lot of websites so you're going

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,330
to be doing this a lot.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:33,370
So let's figure out the best way to go about doing this
so that when I make this smaller it's all responsive.

28
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,959
So your task is to use whatever you've learned up
until now to create this using the starter files and

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,829
don't worry I'll have a solution
video for you after this.

30
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,109
And we'll also go into how easy it is once you have
a layout which is the recommended way to build a

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,809
website starting with the layout first and then
once you have the layout fixed converting this into

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:05,590
something usable like this because styling becomes
really really easy once you have the layout in place.

33
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:14,590
Now the one hint that I want to give here is to use
both flexbox and CSS grid to accomplish your goal

34
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,000
although anything you can do in flexbox.

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,490
You can do with grid and vice versa or at least
most things using the tools in combination flexbox

36
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:31,220
and CSS grid together is really really powerful
to allow you to build a layout like this.

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
So good luck.

38
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:36,420
I know it's going to be tough but
I'll see you in the solution video.

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,750
Bye bye.
