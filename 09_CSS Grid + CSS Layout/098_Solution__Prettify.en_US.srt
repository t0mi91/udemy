00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,960
Let's take just five minutes to quickly make this website a little bit prettier, just to show you how

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,520
easy it is to customize a website once you have the layout done.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,520
I recommend a step that I've mentioned multiple times.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,020
When you build a website, figure out your layout, make it responsive.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,710
And once that's done, the rest is kind of fun.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,990
You just had nice success, probably some images to just prettify it.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:37,910
So in our case, I want to show you a website called Well No Shit, and it's going to really help you

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,980
out because, well, it gives you free design resources to use.

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,270
And they have fonts, illustrations, mockups, UI kits, everything for free that you can use on your

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,710
website.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:01:00,860
In our case, we can use something like Endre over here that gives us a ton of MIT illustrated or licensed

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,650
illustrations.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,460
So if I go to browse now, we see that we have a ton of images that we can use.

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,340
So in my case, I've downloaded one of these images and we're going to use it as our cover photo.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,130
So let's go back to our project and in my cover photo over here, instead of just having cover with

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,880
exclamation marks, I'll just have an image tag.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,580
That will have a class of.

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:40,080
Cover a property that we're going to or class that we'll use and it's going to link to the image that

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,620
I just downloaded in my images folder, again, this you already be in your starter files that I gave

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,940
to you.

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,990
So if you look in that folder, you'll see that we have an image folder.

23
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,920
And from there, we're going to grab the on draw.

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,740
If I save this and refresh and make sure I finish that half with an ending bracket and I refresh, OK,

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,900
and this is a page that's refresh, that's a lot better.

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
But oh, boy, that's a big image.

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,040
We can easily fix this by going to our store.

28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,080
Going to our cover and using the cover class that we've added to the image to just say that we want

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,500
the width to be well, we can say one hundred percent that, but that might be too big.

30
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,680
I don't like it that big.

31
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,670
Let's do.

32
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:46,890
Thirty five refresh for RTM five refresh, that's better, but we want to get rid of this red background

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,050
now let's have everything and wait.

34
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,840
It's going to go up to our HARSONO.

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,890
And we can just actually remove the red from here.

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Now looks a lot better.

37
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,980
All right, so as we see the image sizes and growing, which is good, but it looks nice and pretty

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,030
as the cover photo.

39
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,510
Another thing that I noticed is that when I scroll down, I want the header tab to be sticky, that

40
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,680
is to scroll with me.

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,990
And that's another common pattern that we'll see that's fairly easy to do.

42
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:35,630
We can just give the nav element a sticky class and this sticky class.

43
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,290
Can say that they'll have possession of fixed.

44
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:55,330
And a top of zero that is sort of top, and if I refresh this, it will actually because of the position

45
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,470
fixed, although it works now, it messed up our width.

46
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,650
So we want to make sure that the width is always one hundred percent.

47
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,880
So all we would do is at the end, say, with 100 percent.

48
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,750
Again, these three properties together is a common pattern that you'll see to make.

49
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:23,310
To make navigation sticky so that now when I scroll down, look at that, our navigation is nice and

50
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,620
sticky.

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,670
Let's make the green navigation bar blue.

52
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,530
So I'll turn this into blue.

53
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,240
All right, that looks a lot better.

54
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,030
What else we can change our font, let's say, to something.

55
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,330
Prettier font family, let's just say aerial fire refresh.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,550
All right, that looks a little bit cleaner.

57
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,410
What else can we do here?

58
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,760
Well, just to finish it off, maybe we wanted to do something different when we hover over the zone.

59
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,280
Let's say that with the boxes, when we hover over them, I can just copy and paste this.

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,260
Let's make them tilt a little bit, so I'll say box.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,550
And instead of shadow or box shadow, we'll say transform.

62
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,890
And we'll just say that we want to rotate.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,850
Say negative seven degrees.

64
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:44,810
If I save and refresh, look at that, we have some grid systems that when we hover over them, they

65
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,920
rotate seven degrees.

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,080
I mean, I wanted to demonstrate to you how fast we can convert a website to start looking good.

67
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,790
By no means is this perfect.

68
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:05,480
But by just changing a few properties, we've now gone from this to our final view.

69
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:15,370
And you can imagine how within a day of improving this website, making this a little bit prettier,

70
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,170
maybe you really like.

71
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,000
This websites cards that they have here, so you can just inspect the element.

72
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,580
And perhaps just copy their success styles.

73
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,810
But there's a lot of flexibility here, the important point, though, is the fact that you start with

74
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,500
your layout using flex blocks and access grade.

75
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:50,240
And then it's really up to you and your creativity to design beautiful websites.

76
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,050
I hope that was fun.

77
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,180
I definitely had a lot of fun playing with great inflects box, and I'll see you in the next video.

78
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,220
Bye bye.
