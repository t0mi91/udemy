00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,770
Hey there I want to take a quick video to explain something.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,350
And this is something that I made the mistake of when I first started off when I first started teaching

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,320
myself programming.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,500
You see you start off with HTML and things are fairly simple.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,800
You learn some tags.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,880
You learn some attributes and you starting to get it... how websites are built.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,890
And then you learn about CSS and all the things that you can do to websites to make them pretty

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,790
and beautiful.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,030
But then you start encountering all these CSS properties.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,960
There's so many of them there's no way for you to remember all of them and they each act differently

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,150
on the element so that things like positioning a navigation bar becomes really difficult because you

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,870
have one button that for some reason is styled differently and you can't figure out why.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,680
And that is a problem that everybody has CSS is notoriously difficult and frustrating to learn.

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,020
But this is the mistake that I made when I first started off. I thought I had to know everything in

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,640
HTML.

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,480
Everything in CSS before I even touched Javascript.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,800
So I spent way too much time learning everything about HTML. Everything about CSS... getting frustrated

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:36,550
and frustrated because I couldn't get my websites to look like somebody that has been doing it for years.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
And here's the thing.

20
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,360
If this was that easy then every single person would be doing it but it's not.

21
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,800
It's tough to master these skills but each day you make small little progress step by step.

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,180
So you become better.

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:00,140
However, I don't want you to fall into the trap that I did... that is to not start off learning javascript

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:07,730
right away, because you see these circles over here these circle the size of them represent how important

25
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,250
they are to your career.

26
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:18,180
Now if you want to be a web designer. Designing websites and making things look pretty then CSS is

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,060
quite important to you.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,330
However, if you want to be a developer: somebody that works on logic on javascript and builds applications

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:36,660
Well you need to focus on Javascript, because although you need to know CSS those things that you're

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,700
going to work on while working on Javascript.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,010
So each time you're learning javascript and working with websites you're also as an effect working

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,630
with CSS.

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,540
So although your knowledge might not feel complete right now with CSS, by using javascript and starting

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,630
with javascript as soon as possible we focus on the most important topic at hand.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,910
And little by little as you're learning javascript you're also going to learn more and more about CSS

36
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,870
So I encourage you.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,440
Trust me on this, because I've been through it as well.

38
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,260
Don't start learning every single CSS property trying to memorize everything because that's not how

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,190
you work.

40
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:30,010
A web developer is somebody that uses javascript. Javascript to make smart applications, and that is what

41
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:39,100
your focus should be on, and along the way you will also build your HTML and CSS knowledge... and that is

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,340
the path that we're taking with this course.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,460
Not the longest slowest path but the most efficient path.

44
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,640
I'll see in the next video.
