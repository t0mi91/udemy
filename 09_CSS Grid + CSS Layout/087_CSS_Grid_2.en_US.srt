00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,480
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:07,490
Now that we've gotten used to this CSS grid
system let's introduce a few more properties.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,630
Now another thing we can do with CSS grid
because remember I said it was two dimensional.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,630
That is we can control the rows as well.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,070
So far this is something
that flexbox can do as well.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,879
We can do something like 'grid-template-rows' now
and actually define the way the rows should look as

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
well.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:37,029
So let's say I want to do '1fr 2fr'.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,580
What do you think will happen?

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,420
Let's see.

11
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:47,060
I'm going to save and refresh
and look at that. The first row

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:57,149
has '1fr' but the second row is twice
as big as the first one as we can see here.

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:05,160
And because of the way CSS grid works in the third
row because we haven't really added a third column

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,060
automatically if there's more items
it's going to just start repeating.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,770
So the next row which is the
third row will have '1fr'.

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,550
So I can define different things here.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,030
I can say '3fr' for the third row
and let's say '5fr' for the last row.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
If I refresh and save.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:40,659
If I save and refresh here we see that we have our
new columns or rows but that looks ugly so let's

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,600
just keep it at '1fr' which is the default.

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:56,129
Now another thing that we can do and you'll see a lot
of is the repeat function that we can add to something

22
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,850
like 'grid-template-columns'.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,370
So instead of doing this over
here I can say 'repeat()'.

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,299
And now I say how many times
I want to repeat something.

25
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,740
So the first number is how many times
so let's say three times repeat '1fr'.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,750
So that's like saying '1fr' '1fr' '1fr'
three times.

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:34,020
If I save this and refresh I get one two
three if I do four here and I refresh.

28
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,370
I get four.

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,500
And you can imagine what
happens if we do six.

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,210
We just keep repeating things.

31
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,569
Another thing that we can do is the auto property and
the auto property just simply means fill in whatever

32
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,480
available space we have.

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:06,579
So if I do something like 'auto 1fr 2fr' and I refresh
here you'll notice that the first column doesn't

34
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,530
really have any spaces
outside of the emoji.

35
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:16,550
And 'auto' can also be thought of
as the max size of the content.

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,950
If I make this fox let's say have a content of two
and I refresh you'll see that the 'auto' property

37
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,730
automatically resizes to fit the content.

38
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,089
And because this entire layout is on a grid system
it will make sure that the ones below it will have

39
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,540
the same size.

40
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:48,990
If I do '1fr' here and I refresh you'll see the difference
of all we're talking about it's not automatically

41
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,880
scaling this first grid.

42
00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:00,980
Instead it's going to keep the portions that we have
and extend anything below it that doesn't fit so

43
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,150
'auto' is another really
really good feature to use.

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
But let's fix that.

45
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,170
All right let's tackle a few more
properties in the next video.
