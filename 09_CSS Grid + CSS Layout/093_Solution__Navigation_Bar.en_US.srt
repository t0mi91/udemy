00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,609
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,320
How was the exercise?
Hopefully wasn't too difficult.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,230
But if it was and you
weren't able to finish it.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,189
Don't worry we're going to go over the steps and
luckily for you once we do this you'll have a template

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,039
that you can use for all your websites because what
we'll build will be something responsive that you

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,089
can customize to your own liking but you'll at least
know the best practices after this video of how to do

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,000
these common patterns that
we see in a lot of websites.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,030
So let's get started.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,110
The first thing I want to do to
convert this page is well a few things.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:49,589
Let's go to the HTML page first and let's start off
with the navigation that is the header over here.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,960
A lot of websites have some
sort of a header at the top.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,720
The first thing I want to do is to actually use semantic
HTML and be more descriptive in what are doing.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,059
So in our case instead of div I'm going to use
the nav HTML element and this is something that

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:16,340
we've already talked about and instead of just having
header here I'm going to have a ul class or ul

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,080
element that will have a
class name of main-nav.

16
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:34,589
And in here we can just have li elements that will
have an anchor tag and because we don't really

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,039
have we won't have any links for this example we
can obviously do whatever new HTML page that we

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,120
want to reference but for now
we can just leave it blank.

19
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,720
So the first one will let's just say be about and we
can copy and paste this for the other items as well.

20
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,480
We'll have let's just say
products we'll say our team.

21
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,890
And then finally we'll have contact.
If I save this and refresh.

22
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,510
There is our navigation doesn't
look very good does it in real life.

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,109
Most of the time we see the navigation at the top
and sometimes we also see that there's navigation

24
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,249
links at the top and one all the way to
the right that's pushed to the right edge.

25
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,540
Such as contacts.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,710
So let's try and do that where we have about products
in our team at the top over here and then contacts

27
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,500
all the way to the right at the very edge.

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,579
So for that we can create a new class at the very
last item that we want to let's say push and we'll

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,539
add the CSS classes.

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:58,930
Now if I go to our let's say this first if I go to
style.css We can create our navigation here now.

31
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,060
We have the main nav class which we've
created and in here we want to use flexbox.

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,660
So I'm going to say display flex to activate
flexbox sounds cool when I say activate flexbox.

33
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,130
I want to make sure I remove these little dots in
front of the names so I can just say the list-style

34
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,010
none which will remove
these little pointers.

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,250
And let's say that we want the
font size to be let's say 0.7.

36
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
em.

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,840
If I save and refresh here.

38
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,360
All right things are a little
bit better but still not perfect.

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,000
One is we want to remove any margins.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,480
So I'm going to say margin: 0.

41
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,510
If I refresh.

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,379
All right we've removed some margins but still not
pretty we want to perhaps add some spaces in between

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:11,409
these things I'm going to just have the li class which
is our navigation items and I'll just say that we

44
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,440
want the padding to be 20px I refresh.

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,760
That's a lot better.

46
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,890
OK.

47
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,680
And just to clean things up
let's say that our anchor tags.

48
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:36,069
We also want them to be able to have a color of
let's just use '#f5f5f6' if I refresh it's nice

49
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,100
and whitish that looks good.

50
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,480
And we don't want those underline so I'm
going to say text-decoration: none. Refresh.

51
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:53,810
All good now because I want to start
structuring this as an actual web page.

52
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:01,429
I'm going to go to our zone class and just remove
our padding and margin because we don't really need

53
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,370
it.

54
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,670
Refresh here. Things are going to start looking
ugly but at least we've moved all this whitespace

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,519
and then finally our display.

56
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
We're no longer going to use inline-block.

57
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,560
We want to start using
our flexbox or CSS grid.

58
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,190
In our case our main nav is going to have flex
display so we don't need our inline-block anymore.

59
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,380
We're going to save and refresh.

60
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,639
And that's a lot better because divs are automatically
blocked our displays for these bottom ones are

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,410
now going to just be blocks.

62
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:46,490
But our top one our navbar has flex now which is great
but you'll notice here we have a bit of a white

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,410
gap and this is very common
when you're working with CSS.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,340
Sometimes browsers by default have
some sort of CSS attached to them.

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:08,040
In this case in Google Chrome our body element already
has some predefined CSS classes that are pre-built

66
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,220
by chrome so we can actually remove those
and make sure that our margins are zero.

67
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,670
By saying margin:

68
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,640
auto 0.

69
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,900
And this is something I'll
make sure I spell that right.

70
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,579
This is something that you'll see a lot of and
you'll do a lot of when it comes to just making sure

71
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,890
that the styles are at least
the margins are correct.

72
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,059
When you start off. So if I refresh here. Look at
that! Margins are on and everything just filled

73
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,630
on the page which is great.

74
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:46,150
The last thing I want to do is to move contacts all
the way up to the right and remember the push class

75
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,270
that we added.

76
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,360
Well that's going to be super easy to do.

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:05,029
All we need to do is to add a push CSS class that
says margin-left to be auto and with this auto if

78
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,190
I refresh contacts goes
all the way to the right.

79
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,030
If I inspect this element.

80
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:19,549
So I just right click and click on inspect and let's
make this a little bit bigger so we can see if

81
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,250
I hover over li push here.

82
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,419
We see that each li element has its
own box but because we did margin-left

83
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,489
auto, our li element

84
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,299
it's going to get automatically push because it has
this automatic margin that it creates to the very

85
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,830
end.

86
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,540
If I did margin-right for
example and I refresh here

87
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,800
Our margin would now actually be all the way to the
right to fill up the entire width of the viewport.

88
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,900
But let's go back to left.

89
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,550
Let's go back to the left
save and refresh here.

90
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,949
The neat part about this is
that with this margin-left

91
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:13,080
auto, I can now resize our page and you'll see
that contacts is always going to be to our right.

92
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,959
This is something that you'll see in a lot
of websites and we did that fairly fast.

93
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,550
Not too bad, right?

94
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:27,319
The last thing I want to fix here is as you'll notice
as we get closer and closer it kind of overlaps

95
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,140
our team

96
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,650
and well now we have this weird
little contacts that overflows.

97
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,350
How can we fix this?

98
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,940
Let's tackle that in the next video.
