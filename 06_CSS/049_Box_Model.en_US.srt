00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,890
In this video I want to talk about the box model and CSX.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,290
It's a very important concept and it's something that you might have been kind of curious in the back

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,070
of your head about and that is this image right here in CSX.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:24,450
We have this idea of the box model which has the content it has the padding the border which we've seen

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:24,910
before.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,010
And then the margin.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,020
So we're going to talk about that in this video.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,900
So we have our not so pretty web site right now.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,040
But I have left intentionally our log in page still kind of blank and you see that there's no styles

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,920
applied to it because if we go to the log in page and a drag it over here it's referencing style too

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:51,660
which doesn't have much Stiles happening yet to really emphasize this point I wanted to just instead

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:04,710
of the law at Epsom I'm going to create a div if I give this a class of box model I can go into my style

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:18,360
to which I'm going to drag over here and I can say box model border five pixels solid red I save this

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,310
and refresh OK.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,610
So we have our box model.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,560
Let's add something into this div we have a.

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:38,230
And right now it's covering the entire space but if we add three more divs we'll call this one B the

19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,730
next on C save and refresh.

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:41,970
OK.

21
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:50,840
We have these and if we wanted them all in one line then you might remember that that was display in

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,050
line block and I save refresh and there we have it.

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,290
OK.

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,860
Let's talk about the box model here.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,970
Let's say we wanted more space inside of these for the letters.

26
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:11,430
Well in that case we can use something like padding so padding I can put 20 pixels save and refresh

27
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,250
and there's our padding.

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,120
But let's say we want a different padding so that the sides are wider than the top.

29
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:29,160
In that case we can do something like five pixels of the top 20 pixels on the right side five pixels

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,440
at the bottom and 20 pixels to the left eye refresh and look at that.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,300
And that's just the standard that you'll have to get used to it's Top Right Bottom Left.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,090
You can also actually do padding as you can see in the dropped on bottom left top right to specify.

33
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,150
But this is a quicker way of doing it.

34
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,820
If you remember there is one more and that was margin.

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,930
So margin allows us to create space outside of the border.

36
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,790
So if I go 20 pixels here and I save refresh you can see that we created 20 pixels on the left side

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,690
and right side but also the top and the bottom.

38
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,710
Let's say we only want spaces between the boxes but not at the top and bottom well same principle again.

39
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:33,080
We can do zero pixels 20 pixels zero pixels and 20 pixels so Top Right Bottom Left safe and refresh.

40
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,100
There you go.

41
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,380
Now this might get tedious.

42
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,410
Here is one other shorthand way and that is you can remove this.

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,610
So this means top and bottom.

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,520
This means left and right.

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,040
I say this and refresh.

46
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,090
Nothing should change.

47
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,190
And it doesn't.

48
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,830
And we can do the same at the top here as well.

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,760
Perfect.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,490
One last thing I want to show you is that if we open up our developer tools so again we do inspect you'll

51
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,250
see in our styles that we have our box model.

52
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,410
So if you see over here we have our content.

53
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,090
We have our padding.

54
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,870
And it says 20 pixels five pixels five pixels.

55
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,640
We have our border five pixels five pixels five pixel five pixels.

56
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,410
And then our margin zero with 20 on the side.

57
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:33,370
So again chrome allows you to browse around and make sure that all of these are properly done.

58
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,070
The last thing you might ask is What about this content.

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,460
How can I change this.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:48,410
And that's very simple you can do something like with this to 33 pixels save and refresh and also do

61
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:59,080
height to 55 pixels save and refresh and you'll see over here that in our box model we now have the

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,600
content with 33 pixels by 55 pixels.

63
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,300
All right that's it for now.

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,390
See in the next one.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,800
By.
