1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,780
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,050
In this video we're gonna talk all about selectors.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,200
Let's go back to our home base here.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,890
We can look at our styles.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,440
So far we've only been selecting elements but most likely we need something more than this.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,920
So let's go back to our example and look at what sort of selectors we can have.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,940
Let's say for example that we want the style that we have for the big home header to also apply to our

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,350
p tag.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,640
How can we do that.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:47,650
Well we can do something like this save refresh awesome so that's a way of doing a selector and there's

11
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,110
actually a whole bunch of things that we can do with selectors and I create a for you a nice little

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,280
cheat sheet here that all attach after this lesson and it references to really good resources that I

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,630
recommend.

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,360
One is the CSX tricks that I've already mentioned and you can see over here all the selectors that they

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,460
have they're not as many as they had with properties.

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,450
And it's actually not as overwhelming as you think.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,010
Probably about 30 percent of these are the ones that are abused.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,800
Most of the time.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:28,560
And we also have our good friend W three schools that lists a bunch of the selectors here.

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,370
So let's go over a few things and understand the main selectors that we have.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,300
So I've list them off for you over here.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,660
But I want to point your attention to this line cascading style sheets at the most basic level it indicates

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,240
you'll type.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,010
It indicates that the order of C rules matter and that's something that we've already discussed before

25
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,200
you remember the p tags.

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:01,270
So the order matters because we know that the C Ss will read the last line and make sure that that color

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,400
is green so that's the most basic level.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,430
But there's a few other things that we can do.

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,020
So let's look at the selectors.

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,820
The first one is class.

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:20,820
The class will do something like this so let's say we want to add a few more P tax here and refresh.

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay perfect.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,780
We love the way everything looks.

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,170
But ideally for the paragraphs we want the border to be a slightly different color.

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,390
So while we can do is we can add something called class.

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,770
So the class property we can give it any value we want whatever we want to call us.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,010
Let's call it Web text.

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:55,890
So now we can copy and paste this class attribute to all the p tags and if I go back to my style let's

39
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,140
make this put it up a bit.

40
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:07,450
I can now add period web text and then from here you can see that it's highlighted green and we want

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:17,580
the border to be 5 pixels that should green save and refresh and look at that.

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:27,030
So class is a good way to select a group of elements and make sure that they all have the same s and

43
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,110
we can add multiple ones.

44
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:41,760
So this one can be active and this adds a second class which we can say has the text color red.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,970
So if we save that save this as well and refresh you see over here that now this is Red classes very

46
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,920
very useful.

47
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:02,710
Let's look at the next one the next one is I.D. I.D. is similar to class except for you can use the

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,510
same I.D. only once.

49
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,740
So let's say that we want to group these p tags by wrapping them in a diff and you might remember this

50
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,700
from the Asian male section where we talked about this tag that is very very useful for CSX for occasions

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,590
like this where we want to wrap something so I can do I.D. equals Div 1 and if I save this I can now

52
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:39,020
go back here and for an I.D. You want to do a hash sign they have one and let's do background blue save

53
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,810
and refresh all right.

54
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,770
That looks absolutely hideous.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,370
You know what I think this will look really really good if it was if it had a bit of a passage.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,080
So again we remember G B.A. And if we want to blue if you remember is red green and blue.

57
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,310
So two fifty five and then we'll light opacity of let's say zero point two you save that refresh.

58
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:13,020
All right that looks a lot better but now let's say we copy this and we want to add a second section

59
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,220
now we would have to call this def too.

60
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,670
Again we want to make sure that the I.D. are different.

61
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,100
Otherwise we break the rule.

62
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,610
Now if I save this we'll have something new but no styles on this one.

63
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,880
We want to add a different style for Def too.

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:41,770
So again the selector of Def two will have let's say this one instead of blue has the background red

65
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,680
with opacity of point two.

66
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,710
Let's refresh and look at that.

67
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,870
Alex say a lot better than you used it.

68
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,160
OK.

69
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,870
Let's go back to a couple of the ones so this is a star.

70
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,290
So the star.

71
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,820
It's not used very often but it symbolizes all elements.

72
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,030
So if I do and usually you'll see stars of the top but if I do something like this I can say that we

73
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:15,680
wanted to align everything and say text the line and we want to do right by say that and refresh.

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,200
Now we see that this moved to their right but these didn't.

75
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,700
And the reason is because again something called specificity.

76
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,000
We're saying that yep I want everything to be right.

77
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,890
But then as we go down the CSX you'll see that we are saying H2 MP We want text line to be center.

78
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,600
So these elements instead of coming to the right get to the center.

79
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,870
So just to prove to you that that's correct.

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,190
If I comment this out I save and refresh.

81
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,140
You see everything moves to the right.

82
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,710
OK.

83
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,190
And let's refresh perfect the next one is the element and this something that we've already seen.

84
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,330
You can see over here we're selecting the element and then we're putting the property and values the

85
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,340
next one is the element comma element and that is just like we've done here before.

86
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,950
We want both H2 and P to have these properties.

87
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:23,260
The next one and this is a little bit tricky is element space element and this is a little bit different

88
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,390
in the top on because elements space element what it does.

89
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,290
I'll show you over here.

90
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,380
I saved this and I refresh and what just happened here.

91
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,590
You'll see that now the text the line of center does not apply to these paragraphs anymore.

92
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:52,740
And that's because this syntax of writing a selector means I want you to select all P's that are inside

93
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,650
H two.

94
00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,120
So now even the H two is installed anymore because this says we only want the piece that are inside

95
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,950
H2 and you'll see that we have nothing inside H2 other than the text.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,680
So if I do something like this poem though I like that.

97
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,740
OK perfect.

98
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,360
I say that and I refresh.

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:25,930
You'll see that home gnome is added with these dots let's look at the next one the next one is element

100
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,540
greater than element so this one is a little tricky.

101
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:41,720
So if I go like this and I refresh nothing's changed but this says that I want you to select all P's

102
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,170
all paragraphs that have parent of H to so to show you exactly what that means.

103
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:56,800
Let's add this on our new line so you can see better if now within this P if we do something like this

104
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,760
where we wrap this in a div like so and I refresh this.

105
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:14,700
The style didn't get applied because it only wants piece so paragraphs that are parents of H and this

106
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,290
piece of his parent or her parent is the div.

107
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:28,840
Mr. and Mrs. div if we put this back to the way it was and refresh you'll see that this time it works

108
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,350
because it's saying all peace inside of H2 which is the case hopefully you're still with me.

109
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,100
This is as hard as selectors get.

110
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,230
So once you know these ones honestly you've covered 90 percent and nothing else will scare you.

111
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,910
Let's look at one more element plus element.

112
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:58,030
So this one if I go element plus element and refresh what just happened this says select any p element

113
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,410
that is exactly after an H2 element.

114
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,710
So what does that mean.

115
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:16,510
Well we need to make it so that the P element is right after the H2 so if I go like this save and refresh

116
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,580
you'll see that now we have our styles applied.

117
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,560
Let's look at a few more and like I said these swans are probably the hardest.

118
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,100
These last ones are kind of fun.

119
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,330
OK so we have a hover so hover.

120
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,770
What that means is if I go over here and I put hover at the end this means that when I refresh.

121
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,190
Nothing happens but when I hover my mouse look at that it changes the style to what we just wrote down

122
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,900
over here.

123
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,580
This one's a pretty cool one especially four buttons.

124
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,120
The next one if we look over here is last child and first child that you might guess what that means.

125
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,980
So a good way to demonstrate this is you want to use web text so web text as if you remember is all

126
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:17,950
these little Laura medicines I can say in here the last child refresh and only the last child of each

127
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:26,530
web text and you'll see here that there's two of them because it is selecting the last child this one

128
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:35,160
and this one and then there's also a first child which as you can imagine if I refresh it's like the

129
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,630
first time.

130
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,290
And then finally I want to show you one last thing that I don't recommend but you might see it in some

131
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,880
code bases.

132
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:49,190
So I don't want you to be surprised when you come across it and that is this.

133
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,570
So I can add something like exclamation mark important here and you'll see again we get that nice highlighting

134
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,620
an important means.

135
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,880
Let's see what happens here I refresh and everything just turn pink.

136
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:11,410
Even though this pea over here says I want the color green important overrides any of the cascading

137
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,400
salvia rules and says hey I don't care what anybody else says the pea is pink and you can see here why

138
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,630
I don't recommend using this because although you know for sure that the p tags will be pink if somebody

139
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,720
else comes and starts working on your style sheet and maybe this is hundreds of lines and they don't

140
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,300
know that the important tag is there they can be confused as to Hey How come nothing's turning green.

141
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,510
I can play all around with the color here and nothing's happening.

142
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,800
And again it breaks the rules of cascading style sheets so you don't really want to use it.

143
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,270
But again if you see it out in the wild you won't be surprised this way.

144
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,980
The last thing I want to leave you with is the idea of specificity if this is your first time running

145
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,940
into it.

146
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,270
It might get a little confusing and you do need a bit of time to get used to it.

147
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,680
But trust me you'll get there is just one of these things that everybody goes through and eventually

148
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,530
you'll have an aha moment.

149
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,710
Once the lectures win out in the Cascade it depends on three things.

150
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:25,230
So the first thing is specificity and I have a resource here that really explains it well a simple way

151
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,480
to think about this is how specific is your selector.

152
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,690
So this has the specificity score here.

153
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,660
This has a little bit higher because it's more detailed.

154
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,260
It's more nested.

155
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,400
And this one is higher.

156
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,360
This one is even higher.

157
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,270
And you can see that it keeps going higher and higher.

158
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:56,160
So the more specific something is the more likely it will win out and make sure that that is the style.

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,000
And there's actually a really fun specificity calculator.

160
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,170
It's really hard to say that word.

161
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:12,540
So if you click over here you can type in whatever you want so let's say for example is just one point.

162
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:19,210
But if I do lie that's two and if I do a lie that's even higher.

163
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,440
And if I do a two even higher but then I add an I.D. of food you see that I.D. are even higher.

164
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:35,350
And then if I add another class less to blue you'll see that the specificity increases and you'll see

165
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,740
over here that inline styles is actually the highest.

166
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:48,790
So if you remember that is putting a style directly into a section that will always win out over others

167
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,340
so you can play around with this and I will link to some of the resources that I have in the next section.

168
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,020
But again this is something that they'll be very specific wants to get to a certain problem.

169
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,970
You can figure it out but I hope that makes sense.

170
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,450
Let's go back over here to the last two things.

171
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:16,810
So the other thing was the importance importance is as I mentioned this exclamation mark important.

172
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,290
So that always depends on what kind of styles the cascade gets.

173
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,570
And then finally it is the sauce order.

174
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:32,160
And that is let's go back to our index file if we had a another style sheet here.

175
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,190
Let's say we're importing another style sheet.

176
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,660
And if you remember we have style to here that makes the H2 color blue.

177
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:51,040
If I put this in save and let's go back to our Web site and refresh this turns blue because our browser

178
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:57,850
reads this style sheet and then reads this one and because this one happens after this the later style

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,570
gets added.

180
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:08,070
So if I switch this over here and let's make sure that the H2 has its own style Celestia ish to color

181
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:20,270
red refresh you'll see that this style wins out OK I'm going to leave this out for you in the next section

182
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:27,250
you can play around with CSX and some of the selectors but this is the hardest it's going to get.

183
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,950
And once you remember these rules you're all set.

184
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll see you in the next one.

185
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,620
By.
