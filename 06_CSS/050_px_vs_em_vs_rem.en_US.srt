00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:07,230
Before we finish off the section I wanted to show you one last thing and that is up until this point.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,720
We've used pixels quite a lot but there's two other options that we can actually use.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:24,990
So let's remove our box models for now and instead let's create some paragraphs so using our lawn shorthand

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,850
and let's close this off.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,540
Perfect.

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:39,050
Let's say that we also wanted to have a another paragraph that says introduction save and refresh.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,800
And there you go.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,790
We have our paragraph.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:47,900
Now if we wanted to add some class to this paragraph we can just go in here and we don't need the box

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,720
models so we can delete that.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:58,220
We can do something like P and let's do font size and for font size I've shown you that we can do percentages

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,950
but you can also do pixels so let's say 20 pixels save and refresh and we have pixels.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,650
OK so let's say I want Laura Smithson to be a little bit bigger so we can use span again.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,020
That's kind of like the diff tag that you've seen before is just good for inline.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,030
So again this way we can add styles so I save that go to styles.

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
And now we can still expand and we can do something like this.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,850
We can do font size five year refresh.

19
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:47,810
So what it's saying is we want the font size to be equal to five times the containing element which

20
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,190
is 20 pixels because if you remember we're inside of a p tag just to show you that that is right.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:06,630
If I do 100 pixels and save and refresh that's the same so E M is kind of nice because if I do something

22
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,060
like two E.M. and refresh.

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,570
Well if I change this to Ten pixels and I refresh.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:28,300
This always stays relative to the p one other one I can show you is R E M and that is the size in relation

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,100
to the size of the root element.

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,930
What is the root element.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,660
Well it's the HMO.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,910
So whatever the document is it's always going to be twice as big.

29
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,730
So if I do five refresh that's great but if I change the font size over here if five.

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,490
That won't be affected at all.

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,930
Good job getting this far in the course.

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,760
I know I've thrown a lot of properties and selectors at you but I promise in the next section we're

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
going to start building some real web sites and have fun with all this knowledge.

34
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,760
Can't wait seeing the next one.

35
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,150
Bye bye.
