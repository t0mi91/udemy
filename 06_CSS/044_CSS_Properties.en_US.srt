1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,480
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's make this Web site a little bit prettier than it is now.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,210
And I'm going to introduce you to some CSX properties.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:16,730
Properties are as the name suggests properties that we want to change within a web page and you might

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,780
be asking yourself how many properties are there.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:28,160
And as we did with the AC AML section I have a recommended resource for you and that is CSX tricks.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,780
This Web site anytime you google any questions about CSX most likely some of the top 10 answers are

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,880
going to include something from this Web site.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:46,550
So I highly highly recommended especially if you go to the menu and Alma snack because within this almanac

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,970
we have all the CSX properties listed on here.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:57,170
So anytime you have a question and you want to say what is justified content well you can click on it

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,920
and it will actually give you examples you can play around with it and learn about the specific property

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,910
just like with the HDL tags although there are way more properties you don't need to know all of them

14
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,610
and memorize them because that's not realistic.

15
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,420
That's not the best use of your time.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,840
We're going to focus on the ones that you'll encounter most often and any anytime you seen new ones

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
pop up while you're working you can always look them up and learn about them because they're very very

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,690
simple to read and do.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,540
So let's try a few of these.

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,820
I'm going to start off with our style that CSX over here and let's change a few things we want to have

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,600
our home be in the center of the web page.

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,330
So let's start off with text the line

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,070
and if I type in center and I save my text is now centered.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,410
OK.

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:58,660
We also want to add a border to this image border and this is a little bit unique.

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,330
You can do something like this you can do five pixels which is the size of the border.

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:12,170
What style of border you want so you can do dashed and then the color of the border will do purple save

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,560
refresh.

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,870
And we have a border.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,270
You can also do solid and if it's solid it's a solid border.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,220
OK.

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
What else can we do.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,760
It'll be nice to have an image maybe an entire image for the Web site.

34
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,140
So how do we do that well the tag that we would want to apply to is probably body.

35
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:41,190
So if I go into body and you might notice something here as I'm creating these selectors I'm going from

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:48,780
top to bottom body which is the parent of almost everything is at the top.

37
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,460
And as we get more and more specific we trickle down to smaller elements.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,540
Again we'll get into that later video but just keep that in mind.

39
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,770
So for body will be awesome to have a cool image on our Web site so we can do background.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,000
And you can see the Sublime Text actually audiophiles or has some suggestions for us.

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,010
And we can look through this and pick the one that we want but based on the name looks like we want

42
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,320
background image with a background image.

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,410
We want to specify a U.R.L. in our case.

44
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:31,490
I actually have on my desktop saved a nice little picture and let's title it something simple like background

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,700
image and I got this from a Web site called on splash if you haven't checked it out they have a ton

46
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,750
of high quality free images they can use.

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:46,110
So again here we are referencing are let's put this actually in here.

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,510
So it's in our project folder and then within our project folder we can say that it is background image

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,990
thought JPEG.

50
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,130
So I say this I refresh and look at that.

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,150
We have this image but you can see that it's a big image.

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,770
It doesn't fit the screen.

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,140
So how can we do that.

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,700
We can do background size cover.

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,670
So if we do that and refresh look at that we have a beautiful background on our Web site.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,260
OK.

57
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,400
And let's say we want to remove these little dots next to our links.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,670
We can do that by going into.

59
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,150
Well you want to change our l I elements.

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,070
So we go into style and we can put in here.

61
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:40,950
Ally and we'll do something called list style and we'll go Nunn and refresh and look at that.

62
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:49,680
Those little pesky dots are gone for about whenever I select about I want the cursor to not be this

63
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,780
I want to change a cursor to maybe have this little hand gesture.

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,000
I like to call them Mickey Mouse hands.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,110
OK.

66
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:04,380
So we go into our H2 and we can do something called the cursor and let's say you don't really know what

67
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,800
properties cursor has or you don't even know the property.

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:15,420
You can go to see SS tricks and again go to see look at cursor.

69
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,390
You can kind of guess by the name what it does and it tells you all the information you need to know

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,510
but you can see over here that they even have a demo of what you can do with cursors.

71
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:35,190
So we want the pointer so we can just put a pointer here save.

72
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,220
Let's go back to our Web site refresh and look at that.

73
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,730
We now have a pointer when we hover over about OK.

74
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,510
And maybe the last change we want to do is that we want to make sure that our home about and log in

75
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,280
are on one line.

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,500
This is a little awkward when they're stacked on top of each other and we can do that by selecting.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,640
Let's look over here.

78
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:05,790
We want to select our allies and we can use something called display and display has a few properties

79
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,440
that you can use.

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:18,540
One is block and by default this is actually already a block but there is also something called in line

81
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,110
block.

82
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,640
And if I save this and I refresh look at that we have everything in line.

83
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,920
Now we want to change a few things here we want to make sure that our colors are better than just purple

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,070
and and green and pink and what if we want some specific color and we have a certain design that we

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,490
want for our Web site.

86
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,130
What colors are very very interesting and see SS because there's a few ways that you can do them.

87
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,530
And I want to show you one of my favorite Web sites for picking colors what this Web site does it actually

88
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,300
gives you the colors that you can use along with a nice addition of what it will compliment that color.

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,050
So you can play around with this and change a bunch of criteria as you can click over here and see what

90
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,560
color combinations work.

91
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,420
But let's say we wanted to use something like this.

92
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,880
And if you hover over and click you'll see over here that I get a couple of numbers that we can use.

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:24,010
So the first one is a hex number so hex number as a hash and then the number associated with it.

94
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,330
So I just copied it from the Web site you see the numbers a little bit different but essentially they

95
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:38,410
can use anything from 0 to 9 and then all the way to F so a to F and this represents a specific color.

96
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:48,950
So if I copy this and let's make our color let's make it the color of our header and save this and refresh

97
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,430
you'll see that our color changes OK.

98
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:01,470
We also want the border again to compliment the color let's do this border color.

99
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:08,080
We also have something called our GDP and our GDP again you see over here that there is a hex color

100
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,290
and an RJ color and these are both the same color.

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:19,000
So you can pick whichever one you want in the case of an RG color you can do something like say we want

102
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,060
for our border have RG be color of these values.

103
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,920
So that is the value of red green and blue.

104
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,320
So that's what our GDP stands for and we just wrap it like so.

105
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,670
So now if I save this and refresh look at that I have a nice little outline just to show you of what

106
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,430
exactly I mean by red green and blue.

107
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:50,290
If I set all of these to zero so that means that red is in full force and green and blue are nonexistent.

108
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,310
If I save and refresh that is red.

109
00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:00,510
If I change this to green then that's in green effect and you can imagine here that if I changed a blue

110
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,860
to 255 and everything else is zero this will be blue.

111
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,610
There you go.

112
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,460
So let's go back here to what we had before because I like the other colors way better.

113
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,700
So let's refresh.

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,190
Perfect.

115
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,030
Now RG B lets you do one other cool thing and that is called Our GPA and that is stands for Alpha.

116
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,030
You can actually set the opacity so with the Forth number you can actually do something between 0 and

117
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:39,670
1 and 1 being while opaque and you can still see everything to zero where it's completely transparent.

118
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,620
So let's do zero point five here here you can see that there's a bit of a fade now and our color perfect.

119
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:53,670
So using a tool like this you can really pick what colors you want your website to have and choose the

120
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,960
one that complement each other well.

121
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,030
I use this Web site a lot when creating new Web sites and thinking of color templates to use.

122
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,740
It's a really really good resource.

123
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,290
And you can use hacks and our GP whichever one you want just it's good to have some consistency if you

124
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,860
want to add some opacity so the alpha this last number then definitely use our GPA.

125
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:26,790
OK so going back here our Web site is starting to look somewhat ok but in the next section I want to

126
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,230
talk a little bit about selectors and more things that we can do with them.

127
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,750
I'll see on that one by.
