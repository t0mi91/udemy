1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,910
And welcome back.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:07,790
I want to show you a property that is commonly used with images so I have a really funny picture here

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,800
of an alpaca.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,940
So we're gonna copy that.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,110
Actually we're gonna use the link for this and we're gonna add an image to our Web site.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,760
Let's just make our font size a little bit smaller.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,810
Perfect.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,320
And I'm going to try and add a picture to the left over here.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:33,470
So if we go to our about page and in our section over here we can try and add a picture.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,360
So let's do an image tag.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,990
And if you remember we have a source and that source I just copy and pasted the link and if I saved

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,000
this and refresh.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,950
That's a big picture.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:59,570
So as you may remember we have to do with close to 50 pixels and height 50 pixels let's save and refresh

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,860
and you can see that we broke.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,020
Let's make that a little bit bigger actually.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:12,490
Let's to two hundred and 200.

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,550
Perfect.

19
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:20,840
You can see here that we actually broke a bit of our CSX and that is because if you look over here we

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,080
have used this selector which says immediate neighbour of H2.

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,700
We can just do this for now refresh.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,740
And there you have it.

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,010
But I kind of want the text to be on the right side over here.

24
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,230
How do we do that.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:45,570
Well we can select the image and use a property called float and float.

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,360
You can do right or left.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:58,320
So if we do left and refresh it flows the image to the left and you see that the text wraps around and

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,710
this property was created specifically for these reasons to have images floating to either left or right

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:12,500
and be able to have text wrapped around them you'll see instances where float is being used for positioning

30
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,560
elements and that's not the best practice because it has some funny properties.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,980
For now just use it with images if you can.

32
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,080
And just to show you that I can do it on the right as well I go like this and refresh it flows to the

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,370
right kind of like this better so we'll keep that there so after the image we want to have a

34
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:47,410
in this footer l say Web site made with love close that safe.

35
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,900
And we also want to make this actually a lot smaller so I'm going to do five pixels because I want to

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,500
show you something.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,510
So you see over here I've made this line had very very small but I wanted to demonstrate for you because

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
this is floated to the right.

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,310
Everything just kind of tax on to the left side over here.

40
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,180
And if we wanted to make sure that our footer is at the bottom of the website we would have to use a

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,170
property that almost always comes with float and it's usually put in the property after the float is

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,800
being used.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,680
So in our case footer and we have to specify clear both.

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:36,380
So if I save and refresh we have that at the bottom and let's align it to the center here and let's

45
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,300
two center save and refresh.

46
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,710
Perfect.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,840
Now we have Web site made with love with a whole bunch of gibberish.

48
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,910
But I want to show you that property float for images and make sure that we clear so that any property

49
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:04,270
that you don't want a part of the float is cleared so it can start on its own pass the image we'll see

50
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,120
in the next one.

51
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,590
But by.
