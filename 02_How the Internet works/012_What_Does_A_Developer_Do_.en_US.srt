00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,200
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,850
In this final video I want to show you what this
course is all about what we're learning in this course

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,630
and what we're going to
be able to do at the end.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,090
You may have heard the term full-stack developer
front-end developer, back-end developer. And looking at

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,190
this diagram

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,809
you start to recognize that, HTML, CSS Javascript
you see React in there, we'll get to that,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,670
don't worry about it but that's what a front-end
developer does. The front-end developer is the person

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,800
who makes sure that, when we open up the browser
and go to Google.com that we see Google, we see it

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,879
nice and pretty laid out beautifully, has a search
bar, essentially anything that a user sees, the

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,260
front-end developer does. And that is using HTML,
CSS, Javascript, React and a few other tools.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,049
The back-end developer, that's a person that works
with the server makes sure that when a browser speaks

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,049
to it, it serves up those files and uses some technology
such as Node.js, Express.js, which we're going

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,199
to get into, and then that server is going to talk
also to a database; again we haven't really discussed

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,180
that too much but don't worry there's going to be a
section on it and that's going to use PostgreSQL

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,270
and we're actually going to
be learning that as well.

16
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,230
So we want to build you up as a full-stack developer to
be able to work with all these technologies, so that

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,230
everything revolving
around a web application,

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,419
you're able to build, so get excited.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,669
You're going to learn all of this.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,640
It looks overwhelming, but trust me, just like this How
the Internet Works section it's all going to make sense.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
So I'll see you at the next one. Bye-bye.
