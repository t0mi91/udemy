00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,689
Welcome back! In the last section we talked about how
we have Google.com And if we enter an IP address

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,799
we essentially get all these files from Google so
if we look back at the diagram that we had we see

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,170
here that the Google servers just send us a couple
of files which are a HTML, CSS and Javascript, again

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,090
something that will cover later on.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,389
But for now based on that knowledge
we should be able to break Google.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,320
So let's play with something.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:39,109
If you open up Google Chrome and you go into View,
then developer, then Developer Tools you're going to

8
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,260
have a screen over here that pops up.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,900
You might want to move it up and
down just so you can see better.

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,800
And let me just scroll this down a bit so you
can see you'll see over here that there is

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,251
a little icon on the left
with a pointer in a window.

12
00:00:54,371 --> 00:01:00,091
If you click on that and now go to the website
you'll see it selects a bunch of different things.

13
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:03,601
So it's just an element selector
so, let's just click on this.

14
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:09,860
So when I click on this it takes me to
the part of the HTML file that essentially

15
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,301
tells Google to put in Google search here.

16
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:18,730
So based on that, we can do something fun, we
can get the value over here of Google search.

17
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:22,511
And let's change it to 'Andrei's Search'.

18
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:30,751
Press Enter. Look at that - we have - we now just
changed Google to have 'Andrei's Search' over here.

19
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,161
That's very very cool.

20
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,798
I want to play around with
that and see what you can do.

21
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:40,170
For example if I now select this just like I don't
want this I'm going to press the delete key

22
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,170
and just delete it. Look at that!
I can delete that.

23
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,280
OK I don't like that either.

24
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,951
I'm going to press delete on that as well.

25
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,200
And let's see.

26
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:54,761
You know what on the entire website I
want this entire body thing gone delete.

27
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,331
Look at that.

28
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,321
We just completely deleted Google.

29
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,871
Now you must be freaking out.

30
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:01,081
"What happened?"

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,481
"Am I going to get sent to jail?",
"I just delete the Google!"; well,

32
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:09,231
no, not really,
press enter and Google is back.

33
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,511
Now why is that?

34
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:17,500
Well, if we go back to our diagram we have Google
servers and we were playing around with one of these

35
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:22,171
files and we just modified it we
essentially just said delete delete.

36
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:27,641
So Google was gone but when I made that
request again Google servers, 'no problem,

37
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,031
we have these files'.

38
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,131
They send these files all over again,

39
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,081
back to the server.

40
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:40,430
Hopefully that made sense to you we see that
the browser essentially is a tool - a piece

41
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:45,421
of software that can receive files from
servers and it knows how to read them.

42
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:52,971
So that, look at that, we get pretty Google and we can
type in all the searches that we want in the world.

43
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:57,481
All right let's get to the next section
where we talk about the Internet backbone.

44
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,171
See you on the next one! Bye-bye.
