1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,229
Hey they're welcome back.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,040
All right if you thought so far
everything's been really really cool.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,200
Well, things are gonna get a lot cooler.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,859
We're going to be talking
about the Internet backbone.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,340
So we recognize this because I've been talking
about it for the last couple of lessons.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,039
But some of you may have had a question
that is what do the arrows mean.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,689
I mean it's kind of like magic right.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,590
I just told you that we send off the IP address to
the servers the server responds with some files but

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,660
this is just magic like what do these arrows mean?
So, we're going to talk about that in this lesson.

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,259
And we're going to do that with this really, really
fuzzy diagram that I found online from this website.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,029
It's not the clearest picture but it actually has
some really important things so I want to use that

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,200
to demonstrate to you what
the Internet backbone is.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:59,290
So, as some of you know the way we connect in our homes,
at a coffee shop, or at work is we usually have

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,209
Wi-Fi or you know maybe sometimes we still have people
they are using Ethernet cables

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,160
and connecting through those.

16
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:11,939
But for now let's just focus on the fact that we have
a home and we have Wi-Fi and this Wi-Fi essentially

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,550
gives us Internet from the router.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,640
You can see this little person over here working hard
with a router next to him and this router is connected

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,250
all the way to something called a modem.

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,779
And this is something that if you ever sign up for
Internet or change providers you most likely had

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,970
somebody come to your house
and install something.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,079
And that's this box over here that
essentially allows the ISP the Internet

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,160
Service Provider,
this big building over here,

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,000
we remember that, to connect to it.

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,620
So this modem has the signal
towers that transmit signals of,

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,899
you know Google.com and it receives these messages
and then this is why I picked this image just

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,209
because I think it's incredible you see this wire
that is connected all the way to the ISP and then

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,460
the Internet Service Provider, the ISP is connected to
this magical blue cable that is the Internet backbone

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,429
and something that's really important in this image
is the fact that there's Wi-Fi which is over the

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,225
air but at the end of the day everything
is kind of connected through cables.

31
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,380
So some of you or many of you,
or all of you might be wondering

32
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:30,490
"What the hell is this Internet
backbone thing?"

33
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,290
Sounds cool. But this - this is kind of vague, so I found a
really, really cool - cool thing that we can do together

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,210
I'll post this website in
the notes after this lesson.

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,310
But if you go over here you actually see the Internet
backbone. So, let's say we're in Brazil and we want

36
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,690
to search Google.com.

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,529
Well from Brazil, from our home, through Wi-Fi, it
connects to our router, to our modem and then all the way

38
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,290
to our Internet Service Provider lets say (the) Internet
service provider is over here and then, through

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:08,639
cables it connects all the way to, let's say this point
over here, and let's say, for now that the Google

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,690
servers are located somewhere
in Portugal over here.

41
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,799
Well that signal of me looking for that IP address of
Google and looking for those Google files is going

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,350
to go through this submarine cable.

43
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,739
Yeah, you heard that right.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:30,929
It's a physical cable that goes at the bottom of the
sea floor from Brazil all the way to Portugal where

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,570
the Google servers are.

46
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,080
And then the Google server says yep I got those
files here there are and sends it all the way back.

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,350
Through the ISP all the
way back to our house.

48
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,546
Isn't that cool that there's physical cables that are
connecting, and creating the Internet so you know

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,869
there are times where somebody destroys or something
happens where these cable connections are cut off

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,560
and you sometimes lose
internet connection that way.

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,760
But yeah the Internet backbone is literally just
this network all over the world of connected cables

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,190
so that we can transfer these
files all over the world.

53
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,110
And just to show you how insane this is somebody from the
Opte Project over here - I got this off of Wikipedia,

54
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:27,870
mapped out, and I believe this was in 2015, just 30
percent of the network, and you can see over here that

55
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,240
each one of these dots is an IP address.

56
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,769
So, a computer that is connected to another
computer, that is connected to another computer.

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,819
And that's the Internet.

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:47,085
The Internet is just all these connected computers
that are just transferring files between each other

59
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,760
and as web developers and
this is the coolest thing.

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,089
And that's why I just think everybody should
be a web developer because it's so cool.

61
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,789
You're allowing this to happen.

62
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,450
You're allowing this transferring of files from one
computer to another, transferring knowledge from

63
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:12,159
Brazil to Portugal and all over the world and you get to
be part of it - you get to be part of this networking

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,080
and get to evolve.

65
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:17,939
When this picture of the Internet came to
me I knew that this was the career for me.

66
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,839
So, hopefully that gets you
excited in the next session.

67
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,049
I'm going to show you
something really cool.

68
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,490
Traceroute before we finish up the lesson and we get
into the next sections so hope that was cool see

69
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,510
in the next one.
