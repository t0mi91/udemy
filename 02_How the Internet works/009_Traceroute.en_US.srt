00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,130
Hellooo! Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,630
We mentioned in the last lesson that we're going
to be talking about traceroute. What is that?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,469
Well I just wanted to finally, get the entire
picture of the Internet across and I think this

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,090
is the best way to do it.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,879
Now if you're on a Mac you're going to press CMD
Space and look for a program that comes with your

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,730
Mac called terminal and you're going to
press Enter and you're going to get this.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,520
So it's an application that all Macs have.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,810
If you're on a Windows machine it's called Command
Prompt and in the exercise right after this lesson

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,700
I will show you instructions
on how to access that as well.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:46,609
We're going to talk about traceroute, and if you remember
we spoke about this image of all these connected

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,510
things happening and going to the Internet backbone
and then Google.com finally sends us the files

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,239
back to our house and you can actually monitor how
that's going to work on here using traceroute.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,670
So if we type in traceroute and on
Windows machine, it's actually 'tracert'.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,569
But for now we'll just go traceroute and you
can request for whatever website you want.

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,060
So let's go with Google.com.

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,440
I press Enter and yep, look at that.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,930
It gave me a whole bunch
of hops that it did.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:29,540
So you can see 1 through 9 here so did 9
hopps, so that means 9 stops to this address

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,249
at 172.217.1.14

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,859
So again, that looks like the IP address.

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,579
So again let's always
test our experiments here.

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,320
If I put that in and press Enter, we should get
Google.com. let's see. Look at that; google.com!

23
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,510
So that's a fun little way of you
to see where your requests go.

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,380
And you can monitor, you can see all these IP addresses
are different computers, that are trying to locate

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,000
the Google servers.

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,170
So go ahead in the next section there's a little
exercise you can play around with this and

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,210
just see where all your
requests go all over the world.

28
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,550
I think it's very very cool.

29
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,439
We're going to finish up in the next section with some
fundamentals and what we can do with this knowledge

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,300
that we have, to actually become
really good web developers.

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,220
So see in the next section. Bye-bye.
