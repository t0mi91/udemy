00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,590
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,389
Good job! You've made it this far and
you're probably asking yourself, "Andrei,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,290
this has been really
good really informative.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,039
But where is the coding; I want
to start building some websites."

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,469
And I know,
I know we'll get there don't worry.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:20,249
But without even realizing it you just learned some
really really important fundamental skills, and something

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,380
that will take you very very far in the career of a
web developer because now you know how to improve

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,870
website performance without
a single line of code.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,839
And just so you know we're
gonna get a little silly here.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,059
We're actually going to make sure that you remember
these fundamental skills every time throughout these

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,500
lessons there's going to be chunks of very important
lessons and to symbolize how important they are.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,739
I'm going to get Jean-Claude
Van Damme's help.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,989
So again this is an important lesson.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,380
This is an important fundamental,
web developer concept.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,790
So Jean-Claude Van Damme,
how important is it?

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,520
All right.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,939
So as you can see a very
important concept and what is it?

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,969
Well like I said without writing a single line of code
you now know how to improve a website's performance

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,580
so let's think about this.

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,269
There's three things.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,629
We send 'google.com', we talk to Google servers, and
we get these files back. So just looking at this and

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:27,450
looking at what you've learned so far what's one thing
that would make sure that this this process would be fast?

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,870
Let's look at the first one I'm
going to give you a second to think.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,489
Hopefully you get it.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,040
The first one is location of the server.

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,690
We saw how big the Internet backbone is.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,389
So if the servers are really really close to you,
let's say you're in the States and the servers are

28
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:50,199
just a couple of kilometers away that hop is going
to be really really fast versus if it's all the way

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,130
across the globe.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,640
So location of the server is important.

31
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,809
And we'll talk about these and how big companies
use these to their advantage later on.

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,410
So that makes sense.

33
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,860
Let's look at the next one.

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,470
So the next one is how many trips.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,369
So hopefully, ideally we just have one trip to the
Google servers and Google servers send us all the

36
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,669
files that we need back.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,209
But as we know there's new pages there are searches
so this communication with Google is back and forth,

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:19,980
back and forth.

39
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,680
And the less trips we have, the faster
that we would be able to to get the files.

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:32,469
So how many trips. And then finally size of files
again if this HTML file, CSS file, or Javascript

41
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,780
file is massive and it's
you know 100 megabytes.

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,039
Well that's going to be a lot slower to transfer over
the Internet than it is, if it was just a couple

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,870
of kilobytes.

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,750
So there it is.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,869
These three things are something that you'll take
with you and you'll realize that every time you're

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,449
building an application or web site you're going to
be thinking about these things and these are going

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,900
to help you make sure that you have a performant,
fast web site and we're going to take these with us

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,220
as we go on throughout the course.
Talk to you soon.
