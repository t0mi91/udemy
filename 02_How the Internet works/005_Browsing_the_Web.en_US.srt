1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,440
Hellooooo!

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,950
That was a little bit excessive but I'm
very very excited to start the course.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,959
So in this section we're going to be talking about
browsing the web it's the first part in the How

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
the Internet Works section,
and some of you are thinking right now.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,070
Whoa, whoa, whoa Andrei,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,770
come on.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,159
I know how the Internet works.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,780
Let's get to the

9
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:23,420
heavy, you know, technical stuff.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,459
But this is something that actually
took me quite a few years to learn.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,419
And I see a lot of people just skimming the surface of
this stuff without fully understanding how everything

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,059
works together, without having those foundations it's
actually very, very difficult to think about performance,

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,659
optimizing your sites and so on and so on.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,809
So we're going to start off very, very
basic and we're going to learn something

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,840
that took me many years to to learn and once I figured
this out everything clicked so just hang in there

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,836
trust me, I promise you you'll learn something new
in this section and we're going to be talking about

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,160
browsing the web.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,910
We have over here a laptop and we have our browser
let's say Google Chrome and we typically like

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,419
to say, go to Google and we're going to
visit Google so we type in Google.com

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,190
Well what happens
technically when we do that?

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,900
When we enter Google.com we
press enter on our keyboard.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,409
We ask a question who's
this Google.com fellow?

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,470
And that question gets asked
all the way down to our ISP.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,899
ISP is Internet Service Provider and I put a
dollar sign up here just so you know those are

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,769
the people that you pay so
you can have Internet.

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,949
So if you're in the states
that's Cogiko, Verizon.

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,289
If you're in Canada that'll be Bell or Rogers or you
know, depending on your country you have your big big

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,710
companies that make a lot of money from Internet usage.
So they get that request and they send that off

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,390
to something called the DNS server so Domain Name
Servers and we'll get into that later on in the course.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,520
So don't worry too much about it.

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,280
But essentially it's a phone book - a phone
book that has the list of all these URLs

32
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,150
like Google.com and it has the addresses
of them, so exactly like a phone book.

33
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,890
They know where Google.com is so they say,
"Hey you know, I don't know Mr. Google.com

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,990
personally, but I do know his address.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,470
So you should go check him out."

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,909
So they send off that request back through the ISP
and the website or the web browser, Google Chrome

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:32,040
in this case gets "172.217.7.23" alright,
cool, but nothing is showing up yet.

38
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,370
There's no there's no Google.com,
I can't do any searches yet.

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,980
OK we receive - it's what
we call an IP address.

40
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,560
So think of this as something that every single computer
has one, anything that's connected to the Internet

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,289
has its own address so the laptop that I'm working
on right now an IP address, your laptop or computer

42
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,440
has an IP address.

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,479
So this IP address allows the Internet to work
essentially, it knows our location our address.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,370
So what we do now with Google.com we know this IP
address - the browser sends off another request

45
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,180
to the Google servers and it knows where the Google
servers are because, well because we have this address

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,810
so we go seek it out and you can think
of servers as computers essentially.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,690
My laptop could be a server
your computer could be a server.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,930
Servers are essentially computers that are
sometimes in basements or in huge server farms

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,620
and they have a piece of software running that just
like at a restaurant where a server brings you food.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,439
It knows how to send you files
when you request for them.

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,409
So we send this off and the Google
servers say oh yeah no problem,

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,719
let me give you my HTML CSS and Javascript
and we'll get into what those are

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,179
later on in the course, but think of them as just text
files. They are text files that Google is going to send

54
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,400
to the browser so we
can have Google working.

55
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,509
So let me just minimize this
and show you what it's doing.

56
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:14,160
So we're copying these files and Google server's
saying yeah no problem thanks for asking for Google.

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,170
Here it is.

58
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,580
And the web browser receives the HTML, CSS,

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,109
and javascript.

60
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:26,670
So if we go to the next section boom we
have google.com and everything's working.

61
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,580
Now that sounded like a whole bunch of stuff that
happened in between and when we're on the internet

62
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,639
everything is quite fast but yet underneath the hood
all of that is happening and it's crazy to think

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,759
how fast everything works.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,900
Don't take my word for it.

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,910
Let's just check this process that
I'm not just making stuff up for you.

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,009
If what we learned was correct,
technically we can skip this process right.

67
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,599
I mean if we know the address of Google can we just,
you know, go into this directly and just instead

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,749
of putting Google.com, just put in this in our search
bar and it automatically goes to the Google servers.

69
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,310
Well let's try it out.

70
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,699
Let's let's open up Google here.

71
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,360
And ooh, what a pretty picture.

72
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:16,730
All right.

73
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:25,489
So we go to Google.com, nothing crazy here and
that's great but, what if instead of that I put in

74
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,030
the IP address so 172, there's no way I could
remember this address, so I've done this before

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,239
and I press Enter look at that, Google.com.

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,100
So as you can see, I'm not lying.

77
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,999
It's what's happening. The IP address gets sent to
the Google servers - Google servers sends us a few

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,029
files so that we can finally load Google.com. In
the next section we're going to do something fun.

79
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,735
We're going to break a bit of Google and - and toy
around with the webite again to show you how cool

80
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,270
all of this technology is.

81
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,900
See you in the next one! Bye-Bye!
